Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
