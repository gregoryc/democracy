Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
