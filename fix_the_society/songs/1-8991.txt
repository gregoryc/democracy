Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
