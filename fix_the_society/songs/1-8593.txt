Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too insidious for many to detect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
