Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
