Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
