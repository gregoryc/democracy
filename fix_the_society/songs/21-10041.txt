Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
