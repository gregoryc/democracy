Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
