Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
