Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
