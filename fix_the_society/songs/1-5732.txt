VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
