Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
