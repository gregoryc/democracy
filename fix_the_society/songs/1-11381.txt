Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
