Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
