Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
