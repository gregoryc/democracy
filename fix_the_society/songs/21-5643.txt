Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
