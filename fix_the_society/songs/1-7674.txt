Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Science is  fundamentally inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
