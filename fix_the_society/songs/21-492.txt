Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
