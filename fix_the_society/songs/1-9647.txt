Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
