Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
