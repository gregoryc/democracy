Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
