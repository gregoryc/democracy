Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
