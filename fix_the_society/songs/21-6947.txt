Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
