Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
