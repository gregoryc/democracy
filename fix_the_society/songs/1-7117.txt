Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
