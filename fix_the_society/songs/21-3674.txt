Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
