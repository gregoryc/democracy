Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
