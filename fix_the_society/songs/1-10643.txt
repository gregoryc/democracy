Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
