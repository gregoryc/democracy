Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
