Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
