Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
