Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
