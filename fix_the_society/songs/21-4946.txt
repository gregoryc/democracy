Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
