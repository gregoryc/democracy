Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
