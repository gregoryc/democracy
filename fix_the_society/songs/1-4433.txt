Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
