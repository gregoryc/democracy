Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
