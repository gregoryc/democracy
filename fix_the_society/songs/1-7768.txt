Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
