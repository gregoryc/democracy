Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
