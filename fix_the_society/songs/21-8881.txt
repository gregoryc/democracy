Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
