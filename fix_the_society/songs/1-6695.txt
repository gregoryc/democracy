Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
