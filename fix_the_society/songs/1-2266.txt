Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
