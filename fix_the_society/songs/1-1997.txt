Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
