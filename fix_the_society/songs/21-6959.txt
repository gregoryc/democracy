Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
