Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is too insidious for many to detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
