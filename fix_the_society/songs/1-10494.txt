Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
