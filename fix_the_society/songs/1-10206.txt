Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
