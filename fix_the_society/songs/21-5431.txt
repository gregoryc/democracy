Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
