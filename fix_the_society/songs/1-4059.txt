Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
