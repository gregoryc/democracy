Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
