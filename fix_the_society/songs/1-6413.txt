Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
