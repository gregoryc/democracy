Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
