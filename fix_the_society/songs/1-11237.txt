Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
