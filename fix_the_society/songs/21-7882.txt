Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
