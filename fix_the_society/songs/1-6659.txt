Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
