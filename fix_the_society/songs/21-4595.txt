Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
