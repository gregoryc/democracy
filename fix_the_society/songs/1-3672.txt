Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
