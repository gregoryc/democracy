Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
