Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
