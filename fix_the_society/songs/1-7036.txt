Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
