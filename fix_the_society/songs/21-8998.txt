Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
