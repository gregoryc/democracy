Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
