Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
