Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
