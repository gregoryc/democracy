Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
