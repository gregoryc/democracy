Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
