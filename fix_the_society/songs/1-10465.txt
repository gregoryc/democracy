Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
