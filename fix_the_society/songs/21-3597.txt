Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
