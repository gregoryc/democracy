Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Science is  fundamentally inert
