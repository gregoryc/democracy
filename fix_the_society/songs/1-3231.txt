Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
