VERSE

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
