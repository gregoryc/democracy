Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
