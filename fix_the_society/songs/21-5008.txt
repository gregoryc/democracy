Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
