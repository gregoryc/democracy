Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
