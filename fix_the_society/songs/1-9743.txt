Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
