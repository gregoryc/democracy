Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
