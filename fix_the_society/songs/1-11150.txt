Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
