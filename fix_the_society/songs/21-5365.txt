Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
