Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
