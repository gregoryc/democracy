Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
