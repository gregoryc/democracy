Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
