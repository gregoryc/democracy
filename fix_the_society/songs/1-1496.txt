Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
