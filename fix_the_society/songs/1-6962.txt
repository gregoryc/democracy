Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
