Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
