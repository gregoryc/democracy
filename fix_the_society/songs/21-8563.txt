Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
