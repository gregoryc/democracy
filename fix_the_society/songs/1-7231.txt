Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
