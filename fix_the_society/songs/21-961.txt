Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
