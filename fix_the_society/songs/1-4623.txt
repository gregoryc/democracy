Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
