Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
