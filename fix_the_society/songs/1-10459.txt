Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
