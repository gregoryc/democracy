Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
