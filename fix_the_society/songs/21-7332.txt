Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
