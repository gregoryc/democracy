Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
