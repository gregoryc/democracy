Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
