Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
