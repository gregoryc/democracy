Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
