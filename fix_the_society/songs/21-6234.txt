Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
