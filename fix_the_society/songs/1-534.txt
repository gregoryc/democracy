Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
