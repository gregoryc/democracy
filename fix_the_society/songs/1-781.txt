Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is plain, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
If you talk to them they miss the subject

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
