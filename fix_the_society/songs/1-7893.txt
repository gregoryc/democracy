Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
