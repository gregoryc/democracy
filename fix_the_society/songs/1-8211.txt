Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
