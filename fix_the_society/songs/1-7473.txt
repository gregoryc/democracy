Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
I must speak here, I must interject

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
