Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
