Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
