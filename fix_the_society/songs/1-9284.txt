VERSE

No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
