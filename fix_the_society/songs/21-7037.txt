Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
