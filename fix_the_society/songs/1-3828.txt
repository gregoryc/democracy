Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
