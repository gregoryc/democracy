Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
