Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
