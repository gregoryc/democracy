Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
