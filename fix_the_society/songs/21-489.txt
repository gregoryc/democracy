Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
