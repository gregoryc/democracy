Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
