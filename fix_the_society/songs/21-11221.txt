Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
