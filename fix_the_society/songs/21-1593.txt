Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
