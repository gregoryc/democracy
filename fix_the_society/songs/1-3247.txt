VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
