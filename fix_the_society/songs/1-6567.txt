Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
