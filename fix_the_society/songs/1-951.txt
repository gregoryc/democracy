Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
