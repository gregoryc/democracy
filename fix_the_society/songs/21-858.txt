Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
