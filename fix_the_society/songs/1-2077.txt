VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
