Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
