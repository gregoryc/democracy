Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
