Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
