Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
