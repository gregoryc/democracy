Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
