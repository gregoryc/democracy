Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
