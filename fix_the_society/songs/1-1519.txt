VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
