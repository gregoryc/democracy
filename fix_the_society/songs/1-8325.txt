Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
