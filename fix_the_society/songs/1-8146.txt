Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
