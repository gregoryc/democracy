Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
