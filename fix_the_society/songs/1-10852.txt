Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
