VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
