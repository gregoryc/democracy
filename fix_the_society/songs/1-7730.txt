Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS
