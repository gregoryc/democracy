Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
