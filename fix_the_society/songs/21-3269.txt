Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
