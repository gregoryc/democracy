Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
