Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
