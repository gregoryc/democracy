VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
