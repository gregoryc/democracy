Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
