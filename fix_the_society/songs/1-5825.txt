Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
