Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
