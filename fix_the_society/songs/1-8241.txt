Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
