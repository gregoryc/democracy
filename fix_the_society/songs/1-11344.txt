VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
