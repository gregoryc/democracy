Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
