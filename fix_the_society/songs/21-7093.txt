Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
