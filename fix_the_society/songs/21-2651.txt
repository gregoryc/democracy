Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
