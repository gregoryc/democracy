Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
