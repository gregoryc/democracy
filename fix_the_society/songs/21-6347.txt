Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
