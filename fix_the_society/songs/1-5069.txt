Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
