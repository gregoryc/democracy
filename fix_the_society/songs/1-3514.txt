Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
