Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is plain, anyone can detect

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
