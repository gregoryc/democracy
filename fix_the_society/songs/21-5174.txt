Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
