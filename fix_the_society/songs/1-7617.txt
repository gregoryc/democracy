Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
