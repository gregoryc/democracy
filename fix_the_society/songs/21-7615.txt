Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
