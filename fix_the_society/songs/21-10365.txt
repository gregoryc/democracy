Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
