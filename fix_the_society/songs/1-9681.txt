Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is  fundamentally inert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
