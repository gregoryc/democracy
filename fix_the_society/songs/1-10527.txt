VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
