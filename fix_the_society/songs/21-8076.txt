Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
