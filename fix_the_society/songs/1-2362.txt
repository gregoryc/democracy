Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
