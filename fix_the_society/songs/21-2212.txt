Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
