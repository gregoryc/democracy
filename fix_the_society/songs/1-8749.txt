Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
