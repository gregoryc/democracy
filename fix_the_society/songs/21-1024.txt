Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
