Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
