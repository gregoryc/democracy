Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
