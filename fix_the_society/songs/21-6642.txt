Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
