Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
