Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
