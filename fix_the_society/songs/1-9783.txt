Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
