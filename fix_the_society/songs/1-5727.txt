Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is plain, anyone can detect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
