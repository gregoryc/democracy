Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
