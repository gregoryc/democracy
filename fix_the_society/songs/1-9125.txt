Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
