Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
