Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
