Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
