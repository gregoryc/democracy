Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
