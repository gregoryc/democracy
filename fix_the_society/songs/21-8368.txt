Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
