Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
