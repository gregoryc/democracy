Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
