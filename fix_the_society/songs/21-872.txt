Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
