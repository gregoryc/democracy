Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
