Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
