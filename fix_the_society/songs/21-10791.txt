Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
