Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS
