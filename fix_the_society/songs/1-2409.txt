Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
