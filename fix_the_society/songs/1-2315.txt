Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and moaning like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
