Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
