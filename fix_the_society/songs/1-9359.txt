Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
