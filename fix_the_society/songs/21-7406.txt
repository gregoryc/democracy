Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
