Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
