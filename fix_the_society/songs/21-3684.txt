Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
