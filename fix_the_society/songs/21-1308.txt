Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
