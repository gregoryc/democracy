Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
