Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
