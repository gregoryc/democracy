Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
