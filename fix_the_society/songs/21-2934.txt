Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
