Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
