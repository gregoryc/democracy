Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
