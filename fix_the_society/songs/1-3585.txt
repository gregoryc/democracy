Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
