Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
