Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
