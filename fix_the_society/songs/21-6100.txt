Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
