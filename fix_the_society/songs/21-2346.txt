Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to fight, in order to get rest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
