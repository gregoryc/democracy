Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
