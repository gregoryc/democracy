Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
