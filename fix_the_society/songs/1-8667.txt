Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
