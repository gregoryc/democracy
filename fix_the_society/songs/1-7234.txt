Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
