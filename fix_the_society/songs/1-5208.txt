Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
