Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
