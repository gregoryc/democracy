Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
