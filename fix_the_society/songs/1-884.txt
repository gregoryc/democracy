Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
