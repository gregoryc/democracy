Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
