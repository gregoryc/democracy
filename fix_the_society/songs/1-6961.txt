VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
