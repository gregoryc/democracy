Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
