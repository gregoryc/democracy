Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
