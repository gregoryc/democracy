Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
