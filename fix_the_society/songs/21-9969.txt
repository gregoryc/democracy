Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
