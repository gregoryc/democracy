Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
