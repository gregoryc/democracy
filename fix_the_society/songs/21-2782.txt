Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
