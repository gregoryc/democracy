Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is obvious, anyone can detect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
