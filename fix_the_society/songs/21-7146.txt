Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
