Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
