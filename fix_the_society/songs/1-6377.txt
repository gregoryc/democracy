Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
