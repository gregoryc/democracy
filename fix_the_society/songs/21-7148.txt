Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
