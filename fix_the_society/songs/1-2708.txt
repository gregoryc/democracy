Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
