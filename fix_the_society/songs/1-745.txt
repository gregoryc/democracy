Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
