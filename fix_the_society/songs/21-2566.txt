Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
