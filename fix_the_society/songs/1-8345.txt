Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
