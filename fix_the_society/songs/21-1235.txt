Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
