Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
