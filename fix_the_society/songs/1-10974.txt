Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
