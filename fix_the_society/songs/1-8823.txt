Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
