Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
