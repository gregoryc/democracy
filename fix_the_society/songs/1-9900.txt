Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
