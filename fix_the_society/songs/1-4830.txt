Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
