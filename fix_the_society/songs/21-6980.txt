Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
