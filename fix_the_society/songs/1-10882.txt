Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
