Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
