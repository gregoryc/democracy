Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
