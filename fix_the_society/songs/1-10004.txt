Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
