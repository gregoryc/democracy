Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
