VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
