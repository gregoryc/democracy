Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
