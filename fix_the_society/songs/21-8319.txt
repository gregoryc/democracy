Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
