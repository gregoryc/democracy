Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
