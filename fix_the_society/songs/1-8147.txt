Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
