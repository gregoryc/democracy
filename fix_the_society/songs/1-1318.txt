Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
