Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
