Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
