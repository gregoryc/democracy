Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
