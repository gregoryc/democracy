Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
