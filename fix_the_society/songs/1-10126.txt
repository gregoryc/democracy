VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
