VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
