Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
