Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
