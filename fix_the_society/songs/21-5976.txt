Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
