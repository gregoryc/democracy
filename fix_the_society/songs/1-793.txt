Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
