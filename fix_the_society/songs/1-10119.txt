Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
