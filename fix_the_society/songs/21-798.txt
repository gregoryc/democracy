Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
