Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
