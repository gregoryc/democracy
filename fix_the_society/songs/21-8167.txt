Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
