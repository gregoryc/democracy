Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
