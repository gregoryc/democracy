Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
