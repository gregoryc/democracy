Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
