Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
