Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
