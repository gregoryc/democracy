Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
