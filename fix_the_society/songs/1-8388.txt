Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
