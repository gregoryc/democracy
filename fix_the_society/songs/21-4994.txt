Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
