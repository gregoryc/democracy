Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
