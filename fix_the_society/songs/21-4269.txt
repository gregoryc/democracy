Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
