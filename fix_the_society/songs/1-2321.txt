Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
