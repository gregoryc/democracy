Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
