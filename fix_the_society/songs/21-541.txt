Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
