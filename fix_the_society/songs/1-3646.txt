Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
