Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
