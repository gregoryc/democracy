Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
