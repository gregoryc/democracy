Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
I must speak here, I must interject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
