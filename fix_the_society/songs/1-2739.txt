Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
