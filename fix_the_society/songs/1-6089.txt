Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
