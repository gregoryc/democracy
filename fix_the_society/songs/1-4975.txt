Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
