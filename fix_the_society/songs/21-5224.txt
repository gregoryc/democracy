Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
