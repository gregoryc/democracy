Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
