Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
