Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
