Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
