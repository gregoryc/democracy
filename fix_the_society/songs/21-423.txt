Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
