Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
