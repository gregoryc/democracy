Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
