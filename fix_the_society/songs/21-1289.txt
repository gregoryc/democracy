Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
