Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
