Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
