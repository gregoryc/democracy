Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
