Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
