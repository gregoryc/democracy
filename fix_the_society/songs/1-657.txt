Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
