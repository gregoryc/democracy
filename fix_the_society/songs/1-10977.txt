Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
