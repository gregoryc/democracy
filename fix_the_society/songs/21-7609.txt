Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
