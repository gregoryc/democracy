Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
