Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
