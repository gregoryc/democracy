Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
