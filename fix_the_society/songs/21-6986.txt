Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
