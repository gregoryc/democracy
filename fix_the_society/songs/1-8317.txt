VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
