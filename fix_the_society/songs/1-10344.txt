VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
