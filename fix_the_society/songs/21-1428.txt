Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
