Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
