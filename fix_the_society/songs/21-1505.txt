Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
