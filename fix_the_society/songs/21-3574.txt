Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
