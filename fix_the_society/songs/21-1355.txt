Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
