Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
