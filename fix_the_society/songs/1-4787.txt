Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
