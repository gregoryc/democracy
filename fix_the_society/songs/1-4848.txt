Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
