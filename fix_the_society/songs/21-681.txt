Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
