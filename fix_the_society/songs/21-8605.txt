Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
