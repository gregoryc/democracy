Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
