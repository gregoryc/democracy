Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
