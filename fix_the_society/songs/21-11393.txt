Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
