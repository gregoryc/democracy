Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
