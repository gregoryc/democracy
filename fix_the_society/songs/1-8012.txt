Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
