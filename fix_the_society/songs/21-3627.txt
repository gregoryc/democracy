Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
