Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
