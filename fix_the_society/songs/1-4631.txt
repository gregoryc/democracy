Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
