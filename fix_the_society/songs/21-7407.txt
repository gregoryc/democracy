Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
