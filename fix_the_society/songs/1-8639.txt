Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
