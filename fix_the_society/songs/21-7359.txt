Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
