Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
