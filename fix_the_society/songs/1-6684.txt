Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Science is  fundamentally inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
