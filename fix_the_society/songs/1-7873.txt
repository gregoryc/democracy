Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
