Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
