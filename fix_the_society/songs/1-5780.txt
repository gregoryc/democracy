Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
