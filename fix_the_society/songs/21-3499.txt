Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
