Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
