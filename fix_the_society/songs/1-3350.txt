Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
