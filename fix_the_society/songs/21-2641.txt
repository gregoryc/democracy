Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
