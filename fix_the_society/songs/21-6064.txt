Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
