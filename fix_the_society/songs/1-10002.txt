Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
