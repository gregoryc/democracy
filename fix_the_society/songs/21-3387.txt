Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
