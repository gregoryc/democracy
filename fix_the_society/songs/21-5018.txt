Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
