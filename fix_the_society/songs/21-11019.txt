Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
