Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
