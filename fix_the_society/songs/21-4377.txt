Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
