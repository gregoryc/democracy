Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
