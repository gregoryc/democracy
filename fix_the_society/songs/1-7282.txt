Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
