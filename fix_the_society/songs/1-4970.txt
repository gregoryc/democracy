Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is plain, anyone can detect

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is plain, anyone can detect

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
