Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
