Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
