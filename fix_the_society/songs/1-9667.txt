Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
