Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
