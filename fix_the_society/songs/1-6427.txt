Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
