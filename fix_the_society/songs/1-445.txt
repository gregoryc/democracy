Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
