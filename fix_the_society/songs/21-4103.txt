Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
