Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
