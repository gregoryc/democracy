Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
