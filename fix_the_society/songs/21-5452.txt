Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
