Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
