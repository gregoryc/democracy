Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
