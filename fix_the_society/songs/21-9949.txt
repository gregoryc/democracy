Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
