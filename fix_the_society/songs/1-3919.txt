Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
