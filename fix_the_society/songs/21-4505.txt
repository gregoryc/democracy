Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
