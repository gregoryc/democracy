Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
