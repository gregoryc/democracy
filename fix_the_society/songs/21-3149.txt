Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
