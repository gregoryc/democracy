Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
