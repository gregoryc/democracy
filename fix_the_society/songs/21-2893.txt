Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
