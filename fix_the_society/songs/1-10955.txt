Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
