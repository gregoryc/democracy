Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
