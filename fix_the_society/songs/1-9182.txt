Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
