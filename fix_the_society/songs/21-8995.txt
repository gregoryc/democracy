Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
