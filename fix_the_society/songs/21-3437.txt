Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
