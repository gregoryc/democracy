Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
