Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
