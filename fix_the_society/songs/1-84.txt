Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
