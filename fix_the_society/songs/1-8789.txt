Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
