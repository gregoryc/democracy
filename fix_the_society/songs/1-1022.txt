Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
