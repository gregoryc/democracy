Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
