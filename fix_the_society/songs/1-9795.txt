Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
