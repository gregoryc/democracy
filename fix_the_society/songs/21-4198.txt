Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
