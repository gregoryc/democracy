Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
