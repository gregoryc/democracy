Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
