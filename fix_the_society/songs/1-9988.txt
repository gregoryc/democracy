Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
