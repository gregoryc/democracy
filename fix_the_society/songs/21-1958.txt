Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
