Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
