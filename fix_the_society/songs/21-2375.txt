Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
