VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
