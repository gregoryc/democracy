Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
