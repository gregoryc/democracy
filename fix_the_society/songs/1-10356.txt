Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
