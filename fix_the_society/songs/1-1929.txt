Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
