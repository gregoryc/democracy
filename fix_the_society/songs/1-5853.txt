Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert

They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
