Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
