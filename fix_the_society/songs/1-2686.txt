Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
