Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
