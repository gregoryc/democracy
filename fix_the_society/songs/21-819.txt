Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
