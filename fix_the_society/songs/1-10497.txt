Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
