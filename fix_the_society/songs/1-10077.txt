Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
