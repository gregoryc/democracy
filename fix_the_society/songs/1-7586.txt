Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
