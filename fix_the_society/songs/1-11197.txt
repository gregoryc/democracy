Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
