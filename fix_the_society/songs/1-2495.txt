Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
