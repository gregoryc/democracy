Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
