Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
