Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
