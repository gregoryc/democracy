Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
