Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Science is  fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
