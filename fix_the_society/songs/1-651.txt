Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
