Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
