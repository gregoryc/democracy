Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
