Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
