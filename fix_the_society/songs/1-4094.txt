VERSE

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
