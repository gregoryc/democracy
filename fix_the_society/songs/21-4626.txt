Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
