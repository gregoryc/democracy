Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
