Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
