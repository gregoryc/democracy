VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
