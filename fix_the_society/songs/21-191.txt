Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
