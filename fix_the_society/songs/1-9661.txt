Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
