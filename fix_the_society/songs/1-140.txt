Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
