Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
