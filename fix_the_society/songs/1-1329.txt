VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
