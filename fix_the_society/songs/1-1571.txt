Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
