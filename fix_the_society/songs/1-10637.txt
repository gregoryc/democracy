Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
