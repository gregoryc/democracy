Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
