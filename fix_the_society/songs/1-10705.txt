Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
