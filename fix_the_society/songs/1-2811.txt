Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
