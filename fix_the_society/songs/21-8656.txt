Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
