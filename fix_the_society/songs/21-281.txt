Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
