Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
