Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
