Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
