Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
