Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
