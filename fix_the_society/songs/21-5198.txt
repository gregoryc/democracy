Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
