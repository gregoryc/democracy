Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
