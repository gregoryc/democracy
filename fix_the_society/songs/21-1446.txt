Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
