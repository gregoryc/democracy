Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
