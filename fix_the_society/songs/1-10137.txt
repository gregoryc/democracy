Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
