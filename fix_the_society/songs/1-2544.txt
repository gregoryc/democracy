Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
