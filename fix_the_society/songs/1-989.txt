Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
