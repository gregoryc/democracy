Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
