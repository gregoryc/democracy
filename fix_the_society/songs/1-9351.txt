Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
