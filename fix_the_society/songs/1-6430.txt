Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
