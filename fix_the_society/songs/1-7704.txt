Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
