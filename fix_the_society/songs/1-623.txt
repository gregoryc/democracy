Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
