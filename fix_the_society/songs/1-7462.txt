Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
