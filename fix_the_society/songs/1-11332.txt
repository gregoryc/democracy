Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
