Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
