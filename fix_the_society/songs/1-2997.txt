Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
