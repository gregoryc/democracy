Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
