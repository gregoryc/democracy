Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
