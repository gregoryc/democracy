Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
