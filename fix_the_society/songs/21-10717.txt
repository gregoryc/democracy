Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
