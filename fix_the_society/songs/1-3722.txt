VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
