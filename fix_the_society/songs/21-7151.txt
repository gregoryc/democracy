Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
