Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
