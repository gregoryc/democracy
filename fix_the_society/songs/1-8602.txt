Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
