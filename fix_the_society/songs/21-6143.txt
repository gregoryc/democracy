Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
