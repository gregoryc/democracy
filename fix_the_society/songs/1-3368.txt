Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They do junk, they do dirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
