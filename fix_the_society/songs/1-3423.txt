Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Whining and complaining like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
