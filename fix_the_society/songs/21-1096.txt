Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
