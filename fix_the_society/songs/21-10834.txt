Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
