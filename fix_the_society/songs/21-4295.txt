Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
