Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
