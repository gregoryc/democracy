Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
