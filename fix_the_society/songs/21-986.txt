Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
