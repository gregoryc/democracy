Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
