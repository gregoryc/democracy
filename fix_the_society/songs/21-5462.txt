Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
