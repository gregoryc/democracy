Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
