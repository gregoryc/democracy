Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
