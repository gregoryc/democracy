Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
