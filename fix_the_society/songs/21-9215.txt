Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
