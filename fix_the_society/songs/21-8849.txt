Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
