Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
