Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
