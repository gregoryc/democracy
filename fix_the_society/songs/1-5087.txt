Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
