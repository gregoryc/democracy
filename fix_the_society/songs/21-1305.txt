Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
