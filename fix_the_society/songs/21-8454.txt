Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
