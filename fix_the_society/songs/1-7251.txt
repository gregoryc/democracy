Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
