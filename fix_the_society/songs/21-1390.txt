Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
