Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
