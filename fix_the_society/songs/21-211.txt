Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
