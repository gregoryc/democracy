VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
