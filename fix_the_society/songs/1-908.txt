Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
