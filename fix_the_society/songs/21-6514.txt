Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
