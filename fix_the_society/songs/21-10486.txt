Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
