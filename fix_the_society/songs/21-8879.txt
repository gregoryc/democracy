Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
