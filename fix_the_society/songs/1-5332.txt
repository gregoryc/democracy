Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
