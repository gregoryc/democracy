Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
