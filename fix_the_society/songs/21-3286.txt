Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
