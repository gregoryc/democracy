Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
