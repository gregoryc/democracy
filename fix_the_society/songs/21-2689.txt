Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
