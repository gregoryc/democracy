Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
