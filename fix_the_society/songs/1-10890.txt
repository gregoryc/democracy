Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
