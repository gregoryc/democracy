Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
