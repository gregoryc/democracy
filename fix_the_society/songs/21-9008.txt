Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
