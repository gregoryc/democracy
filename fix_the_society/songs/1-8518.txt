Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
