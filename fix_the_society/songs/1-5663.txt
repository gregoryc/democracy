Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
