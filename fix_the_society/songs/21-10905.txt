Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
