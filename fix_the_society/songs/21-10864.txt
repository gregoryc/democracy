Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
