Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
