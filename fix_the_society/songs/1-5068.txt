Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

You don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
