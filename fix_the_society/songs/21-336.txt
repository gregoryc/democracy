Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
