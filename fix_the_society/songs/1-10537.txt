Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
