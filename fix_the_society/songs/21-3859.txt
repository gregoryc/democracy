Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
