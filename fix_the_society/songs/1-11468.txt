Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and complaining like a kid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
