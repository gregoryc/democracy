Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
