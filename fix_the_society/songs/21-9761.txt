Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
