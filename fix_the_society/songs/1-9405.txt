Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
