Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
