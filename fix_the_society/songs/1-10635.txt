Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
