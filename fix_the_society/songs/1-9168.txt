Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
