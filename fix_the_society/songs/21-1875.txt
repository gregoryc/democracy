Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
