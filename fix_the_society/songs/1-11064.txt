Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
