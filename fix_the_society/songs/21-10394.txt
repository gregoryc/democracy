Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
