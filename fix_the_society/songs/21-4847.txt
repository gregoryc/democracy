Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
