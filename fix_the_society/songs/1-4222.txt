Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Predetermined thought is that of a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
