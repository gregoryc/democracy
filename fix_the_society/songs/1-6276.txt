Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
