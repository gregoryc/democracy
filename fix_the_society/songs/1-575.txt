Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
