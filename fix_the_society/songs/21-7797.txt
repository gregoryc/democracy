Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
