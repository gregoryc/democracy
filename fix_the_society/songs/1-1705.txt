Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
