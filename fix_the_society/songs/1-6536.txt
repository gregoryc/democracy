VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
