Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
