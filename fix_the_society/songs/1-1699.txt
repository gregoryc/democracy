Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
