Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
