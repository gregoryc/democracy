Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
