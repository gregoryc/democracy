Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
