Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
