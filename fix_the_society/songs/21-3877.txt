Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
