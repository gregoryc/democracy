Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
