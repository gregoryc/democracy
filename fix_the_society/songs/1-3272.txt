Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
