Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
