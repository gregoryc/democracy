VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
