Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
