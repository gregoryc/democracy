Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
