Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
