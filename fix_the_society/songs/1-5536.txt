Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
