Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
