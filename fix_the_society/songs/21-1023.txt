Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
