Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
