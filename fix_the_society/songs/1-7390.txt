Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
