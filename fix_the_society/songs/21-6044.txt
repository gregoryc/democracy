Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
