Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
