Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
