Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
