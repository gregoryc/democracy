Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
