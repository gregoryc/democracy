Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
