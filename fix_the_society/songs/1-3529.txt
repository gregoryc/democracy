VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
