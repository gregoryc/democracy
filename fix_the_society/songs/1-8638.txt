Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
