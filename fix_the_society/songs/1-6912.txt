VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
