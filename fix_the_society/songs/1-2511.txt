Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
