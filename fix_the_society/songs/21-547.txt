Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
