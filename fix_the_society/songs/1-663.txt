Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
