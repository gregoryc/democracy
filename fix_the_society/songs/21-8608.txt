Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
