Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
