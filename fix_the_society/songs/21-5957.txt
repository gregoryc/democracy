Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
