VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
