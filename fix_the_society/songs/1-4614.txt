Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
