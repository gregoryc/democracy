Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
