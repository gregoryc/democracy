Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
