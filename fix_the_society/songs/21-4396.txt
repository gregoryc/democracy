Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
