Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
