Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
