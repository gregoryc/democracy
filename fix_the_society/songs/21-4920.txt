Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
