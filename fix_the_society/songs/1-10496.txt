Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
