Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
