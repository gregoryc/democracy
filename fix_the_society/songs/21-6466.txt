Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
