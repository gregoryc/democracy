Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
