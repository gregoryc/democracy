Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
