Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
