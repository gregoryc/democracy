Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
