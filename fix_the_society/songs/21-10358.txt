Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
