Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
