Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
