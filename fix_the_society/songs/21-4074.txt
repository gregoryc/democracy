Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
