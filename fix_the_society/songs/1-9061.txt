Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
