Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
