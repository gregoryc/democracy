Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
