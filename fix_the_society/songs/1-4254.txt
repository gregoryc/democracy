Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
