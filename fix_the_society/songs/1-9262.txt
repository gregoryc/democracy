Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
