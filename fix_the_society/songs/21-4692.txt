Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
