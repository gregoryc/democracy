Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
