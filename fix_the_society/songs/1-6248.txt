Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and complaining like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
