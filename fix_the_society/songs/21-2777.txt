Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
