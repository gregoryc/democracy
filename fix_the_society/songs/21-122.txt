Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
