Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
