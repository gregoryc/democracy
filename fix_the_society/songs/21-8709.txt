Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
