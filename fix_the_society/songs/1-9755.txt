VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
