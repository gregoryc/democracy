Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
