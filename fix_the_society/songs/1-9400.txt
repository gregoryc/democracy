Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
