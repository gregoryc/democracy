Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
