Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
