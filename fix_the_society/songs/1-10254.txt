Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
