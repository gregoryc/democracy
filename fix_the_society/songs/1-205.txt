Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
