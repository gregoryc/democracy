Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
