Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
