VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
