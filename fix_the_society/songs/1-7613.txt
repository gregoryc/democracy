Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
