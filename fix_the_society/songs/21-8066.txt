Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
