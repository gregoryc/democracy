Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
