Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
