Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
