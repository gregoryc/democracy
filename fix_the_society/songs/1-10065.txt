Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
