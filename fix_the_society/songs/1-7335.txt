Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
