Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
