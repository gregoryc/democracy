Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
