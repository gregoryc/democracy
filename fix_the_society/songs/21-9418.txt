Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
