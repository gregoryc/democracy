Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
