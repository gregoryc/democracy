Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
