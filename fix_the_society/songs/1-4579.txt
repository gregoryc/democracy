Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
