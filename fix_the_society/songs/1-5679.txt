Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
