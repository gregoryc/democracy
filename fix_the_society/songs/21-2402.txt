Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
