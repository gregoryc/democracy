Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
