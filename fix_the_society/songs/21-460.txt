Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
