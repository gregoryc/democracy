Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
