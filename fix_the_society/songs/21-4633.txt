Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
