Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
