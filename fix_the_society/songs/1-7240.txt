VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
