Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
