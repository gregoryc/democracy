Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
