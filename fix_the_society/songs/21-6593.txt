Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
