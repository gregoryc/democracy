Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
