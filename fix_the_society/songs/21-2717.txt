Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
