Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
