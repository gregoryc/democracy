Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
