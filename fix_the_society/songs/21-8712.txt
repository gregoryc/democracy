Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
