Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
