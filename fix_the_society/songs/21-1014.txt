Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
