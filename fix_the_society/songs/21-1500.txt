Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
