Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
