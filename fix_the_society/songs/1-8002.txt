Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
