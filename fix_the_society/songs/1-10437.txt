Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
