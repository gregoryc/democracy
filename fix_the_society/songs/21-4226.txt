Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
