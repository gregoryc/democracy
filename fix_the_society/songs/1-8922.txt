Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
