Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
