Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
