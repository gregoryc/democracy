Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
