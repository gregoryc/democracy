Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
