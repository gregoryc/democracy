Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
