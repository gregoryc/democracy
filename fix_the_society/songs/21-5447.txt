Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
