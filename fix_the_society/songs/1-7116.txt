Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
