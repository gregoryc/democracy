Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
