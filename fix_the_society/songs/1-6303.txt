Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
