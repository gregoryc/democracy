Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
