Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
