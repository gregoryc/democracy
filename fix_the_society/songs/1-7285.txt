Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They do junk, they do dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
