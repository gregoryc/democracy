Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
