Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
