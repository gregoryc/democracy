Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
