Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
