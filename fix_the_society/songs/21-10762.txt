Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
