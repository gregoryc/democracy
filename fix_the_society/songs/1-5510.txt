Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
