Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
