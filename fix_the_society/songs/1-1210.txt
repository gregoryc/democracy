Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
