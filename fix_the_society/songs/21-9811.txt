Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
