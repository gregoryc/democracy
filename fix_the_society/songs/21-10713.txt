Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
