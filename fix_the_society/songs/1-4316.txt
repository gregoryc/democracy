Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
