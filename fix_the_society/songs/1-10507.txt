VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
