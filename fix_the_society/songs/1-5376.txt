Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Away from the truth they hid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
