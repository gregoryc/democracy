VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
