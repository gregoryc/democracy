Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
