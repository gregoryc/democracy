Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
