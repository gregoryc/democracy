Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
