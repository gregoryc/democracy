Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
