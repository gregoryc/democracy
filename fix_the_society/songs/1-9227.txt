Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and moaning like a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
