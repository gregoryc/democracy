Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
