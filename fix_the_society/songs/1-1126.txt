Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
