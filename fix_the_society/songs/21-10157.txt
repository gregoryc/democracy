Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
