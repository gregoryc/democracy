Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
