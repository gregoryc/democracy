Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
