Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
