Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
