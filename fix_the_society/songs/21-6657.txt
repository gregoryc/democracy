Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
