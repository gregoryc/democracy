Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
