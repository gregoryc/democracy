Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
