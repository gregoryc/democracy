Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
