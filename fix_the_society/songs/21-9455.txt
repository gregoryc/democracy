Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
