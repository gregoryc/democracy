Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
