Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
