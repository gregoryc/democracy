Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
