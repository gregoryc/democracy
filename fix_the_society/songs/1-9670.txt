Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Science is  fundamentally inert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
