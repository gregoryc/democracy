Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
