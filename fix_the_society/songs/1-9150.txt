Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
