Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
