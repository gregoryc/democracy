Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
