Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
