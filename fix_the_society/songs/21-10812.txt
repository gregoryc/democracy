Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
