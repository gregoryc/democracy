Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
