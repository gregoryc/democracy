Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
