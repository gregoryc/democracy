Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
