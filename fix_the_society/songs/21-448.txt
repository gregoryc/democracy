Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
