Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
