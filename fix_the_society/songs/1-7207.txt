Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
