Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
