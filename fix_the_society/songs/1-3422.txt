Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
