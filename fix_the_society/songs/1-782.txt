Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
