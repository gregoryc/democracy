Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
