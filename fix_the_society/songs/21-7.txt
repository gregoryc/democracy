Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
