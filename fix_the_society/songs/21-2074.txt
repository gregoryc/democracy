Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
