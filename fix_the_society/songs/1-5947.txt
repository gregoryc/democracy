Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
