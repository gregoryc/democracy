Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
