Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
