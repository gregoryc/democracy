Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
