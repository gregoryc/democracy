Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
