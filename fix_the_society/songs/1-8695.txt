Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
