Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
