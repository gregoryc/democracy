VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
