Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
