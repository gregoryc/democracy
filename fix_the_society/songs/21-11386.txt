Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
