Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
