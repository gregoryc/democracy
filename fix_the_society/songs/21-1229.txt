Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
