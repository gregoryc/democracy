Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
