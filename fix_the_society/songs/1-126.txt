Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
