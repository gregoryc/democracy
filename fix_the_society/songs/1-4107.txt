Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Whining and moaning like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
