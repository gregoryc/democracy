Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
