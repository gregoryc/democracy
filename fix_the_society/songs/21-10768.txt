Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
