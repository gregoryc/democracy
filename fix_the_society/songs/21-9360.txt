Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
