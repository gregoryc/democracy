Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
