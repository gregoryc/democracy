Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
