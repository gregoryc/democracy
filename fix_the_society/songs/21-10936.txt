Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
