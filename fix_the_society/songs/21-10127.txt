Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
