Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
