Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
