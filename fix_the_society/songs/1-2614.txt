Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
