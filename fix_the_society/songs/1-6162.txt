Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
