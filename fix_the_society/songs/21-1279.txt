Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
