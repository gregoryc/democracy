Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
