Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
