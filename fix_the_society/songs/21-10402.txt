Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
