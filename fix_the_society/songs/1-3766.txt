Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
