Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
