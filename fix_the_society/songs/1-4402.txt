Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
