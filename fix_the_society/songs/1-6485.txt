Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
