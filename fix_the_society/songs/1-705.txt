VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
