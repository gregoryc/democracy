Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
