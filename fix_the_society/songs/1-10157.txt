Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
