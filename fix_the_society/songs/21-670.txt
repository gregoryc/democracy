Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
