Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while acting like a kid

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
