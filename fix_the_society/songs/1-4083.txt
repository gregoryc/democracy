Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
