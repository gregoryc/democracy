Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
