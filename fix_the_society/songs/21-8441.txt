Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
