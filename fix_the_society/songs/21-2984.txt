Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
