Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Evading conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
