Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
