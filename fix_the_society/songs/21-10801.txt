Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
