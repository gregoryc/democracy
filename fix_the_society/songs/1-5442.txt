VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
