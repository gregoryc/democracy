Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
