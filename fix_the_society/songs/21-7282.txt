Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
