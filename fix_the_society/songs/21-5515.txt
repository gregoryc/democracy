Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
