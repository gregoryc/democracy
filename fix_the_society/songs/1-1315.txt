Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
