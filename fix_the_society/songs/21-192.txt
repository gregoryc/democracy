Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
