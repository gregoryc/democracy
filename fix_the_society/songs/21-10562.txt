Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
