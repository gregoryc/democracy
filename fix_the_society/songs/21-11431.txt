Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
