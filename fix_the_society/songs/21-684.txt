Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
