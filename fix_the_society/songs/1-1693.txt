Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
