Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
