VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
