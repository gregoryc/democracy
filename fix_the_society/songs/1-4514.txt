Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
