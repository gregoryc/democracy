Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
