Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
