Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
