Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
