Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
