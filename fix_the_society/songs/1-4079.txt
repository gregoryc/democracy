Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
