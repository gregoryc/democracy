Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
