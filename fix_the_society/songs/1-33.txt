Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
