Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
