Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
