Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
