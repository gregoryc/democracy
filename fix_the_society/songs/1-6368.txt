Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
