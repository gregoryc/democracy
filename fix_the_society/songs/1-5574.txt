VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
