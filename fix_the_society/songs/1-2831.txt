Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
