Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
