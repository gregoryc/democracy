Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
