Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
