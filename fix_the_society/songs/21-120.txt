Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
