Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
