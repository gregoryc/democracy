Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
