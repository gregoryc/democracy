Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
