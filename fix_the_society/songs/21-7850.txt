Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
