Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
