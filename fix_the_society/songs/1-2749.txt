Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
