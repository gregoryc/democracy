Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
