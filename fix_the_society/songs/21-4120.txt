Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
