Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
