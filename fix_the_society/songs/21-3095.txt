Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
