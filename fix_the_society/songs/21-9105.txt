Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
