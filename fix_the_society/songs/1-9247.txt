Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
