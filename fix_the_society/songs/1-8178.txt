VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
