Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
