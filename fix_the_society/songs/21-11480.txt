Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
