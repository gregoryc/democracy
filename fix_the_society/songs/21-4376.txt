Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
