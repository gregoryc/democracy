Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
