Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
