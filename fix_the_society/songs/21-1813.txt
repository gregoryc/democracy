Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
