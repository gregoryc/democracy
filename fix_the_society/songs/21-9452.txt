Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
