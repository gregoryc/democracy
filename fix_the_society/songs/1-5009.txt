VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
