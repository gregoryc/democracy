Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
