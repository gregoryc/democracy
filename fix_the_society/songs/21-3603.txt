Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
