Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
