Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They do junk, they do dirt

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
