Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
