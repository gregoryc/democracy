Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
