Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
