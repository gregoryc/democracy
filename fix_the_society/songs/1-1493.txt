Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
