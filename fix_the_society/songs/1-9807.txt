Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
