Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
