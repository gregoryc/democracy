Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
