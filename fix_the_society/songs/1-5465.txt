Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

VERSE

This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Science is  fundamentally inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
