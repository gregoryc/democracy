Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
