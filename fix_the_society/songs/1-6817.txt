Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
