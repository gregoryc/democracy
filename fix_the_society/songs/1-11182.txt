Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
