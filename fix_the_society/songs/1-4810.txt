Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
