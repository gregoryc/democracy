Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
