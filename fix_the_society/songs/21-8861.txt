Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
