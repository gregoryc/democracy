Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
