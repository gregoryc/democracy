Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
