Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth they hid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
