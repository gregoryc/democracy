Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
