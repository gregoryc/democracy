Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
