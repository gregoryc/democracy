Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
