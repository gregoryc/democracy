Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

You make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
