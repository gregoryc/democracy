Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
