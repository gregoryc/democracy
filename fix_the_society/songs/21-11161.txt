Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
