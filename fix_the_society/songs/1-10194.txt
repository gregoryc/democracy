Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their own principles are something they do not respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their own principles are something they do not respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their own principles are something they do not respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
