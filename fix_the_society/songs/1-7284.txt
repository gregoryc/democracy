Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
