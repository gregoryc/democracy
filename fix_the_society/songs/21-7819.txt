Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
