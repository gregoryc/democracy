Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
