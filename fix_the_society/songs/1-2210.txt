Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too insidious for many to detect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
