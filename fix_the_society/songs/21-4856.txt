Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
