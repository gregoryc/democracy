Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
