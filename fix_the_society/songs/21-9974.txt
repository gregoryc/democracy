Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
