Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
