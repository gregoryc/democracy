Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
