Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
