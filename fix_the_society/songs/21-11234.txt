Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
