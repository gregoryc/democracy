Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They do junk, they do dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
