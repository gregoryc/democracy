Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
