Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
