VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
