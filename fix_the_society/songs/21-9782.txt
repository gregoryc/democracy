Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
