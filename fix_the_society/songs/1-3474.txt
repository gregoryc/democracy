Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Playing only the worst card
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
