Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
