Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
