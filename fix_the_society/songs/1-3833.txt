Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
