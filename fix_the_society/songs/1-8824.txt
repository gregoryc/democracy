Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
