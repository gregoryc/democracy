Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
