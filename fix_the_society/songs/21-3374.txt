Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
