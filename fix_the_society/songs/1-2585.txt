Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is too insidious for many to detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
