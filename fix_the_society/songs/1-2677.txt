Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
