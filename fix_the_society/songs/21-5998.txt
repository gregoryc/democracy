Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
