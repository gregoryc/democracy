Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
