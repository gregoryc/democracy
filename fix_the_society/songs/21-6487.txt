Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
