Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
