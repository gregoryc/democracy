Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
