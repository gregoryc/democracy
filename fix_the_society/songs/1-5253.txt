Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
