Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
