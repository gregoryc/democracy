Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
