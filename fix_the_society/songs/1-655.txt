Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
