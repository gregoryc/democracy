Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
