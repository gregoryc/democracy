Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
