Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
