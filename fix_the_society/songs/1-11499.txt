Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their minds, they cannot exert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
