VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
