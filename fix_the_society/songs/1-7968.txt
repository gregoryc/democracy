Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
