Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
