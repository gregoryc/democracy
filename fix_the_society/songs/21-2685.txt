Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
