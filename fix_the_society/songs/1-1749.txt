Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
