Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
