Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
