Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
