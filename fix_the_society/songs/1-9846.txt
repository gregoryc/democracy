Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
