Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
