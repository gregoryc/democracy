Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
