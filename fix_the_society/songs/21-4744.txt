Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
