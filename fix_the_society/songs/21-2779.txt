Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
