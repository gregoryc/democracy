Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
