Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
