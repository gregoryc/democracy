Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
