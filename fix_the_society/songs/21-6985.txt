Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
