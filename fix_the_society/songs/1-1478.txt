Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
