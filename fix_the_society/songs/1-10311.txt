Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
