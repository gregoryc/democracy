Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
