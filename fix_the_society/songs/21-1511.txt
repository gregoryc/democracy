Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
