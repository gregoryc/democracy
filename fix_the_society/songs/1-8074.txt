Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
