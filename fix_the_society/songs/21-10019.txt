Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
