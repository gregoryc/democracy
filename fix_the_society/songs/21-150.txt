Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
