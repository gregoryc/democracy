Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
