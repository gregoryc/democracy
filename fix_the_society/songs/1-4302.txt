Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
