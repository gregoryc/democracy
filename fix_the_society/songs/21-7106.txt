Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
