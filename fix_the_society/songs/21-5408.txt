Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
