Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
