Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
