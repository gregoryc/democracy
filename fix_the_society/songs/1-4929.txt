Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
