Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
