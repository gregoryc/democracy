Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
