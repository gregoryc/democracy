Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
