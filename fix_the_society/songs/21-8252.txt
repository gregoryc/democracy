Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
