Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
