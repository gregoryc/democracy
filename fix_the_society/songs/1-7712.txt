Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
