VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
