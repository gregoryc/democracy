Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
