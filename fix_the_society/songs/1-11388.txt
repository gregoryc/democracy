Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
