Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
