Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
