Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
