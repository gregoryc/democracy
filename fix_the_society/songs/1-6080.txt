Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
