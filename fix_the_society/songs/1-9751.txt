Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
