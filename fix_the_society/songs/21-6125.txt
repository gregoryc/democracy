Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
