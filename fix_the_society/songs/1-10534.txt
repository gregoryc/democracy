Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
