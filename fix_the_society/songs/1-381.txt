Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
