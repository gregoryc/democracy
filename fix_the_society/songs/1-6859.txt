Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
