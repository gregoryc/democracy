VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
