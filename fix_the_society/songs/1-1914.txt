Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
