Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
