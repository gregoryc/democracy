Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
