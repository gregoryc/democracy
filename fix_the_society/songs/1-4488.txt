VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
