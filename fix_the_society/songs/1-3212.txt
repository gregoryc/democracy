VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
