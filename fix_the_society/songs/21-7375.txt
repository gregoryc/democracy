Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
