Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
