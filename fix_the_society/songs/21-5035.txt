Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
