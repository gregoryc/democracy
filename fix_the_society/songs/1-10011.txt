Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
