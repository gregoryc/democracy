VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
