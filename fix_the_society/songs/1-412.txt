Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
