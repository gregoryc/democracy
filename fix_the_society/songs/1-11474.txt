Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
