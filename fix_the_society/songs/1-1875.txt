Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
