Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
