Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
