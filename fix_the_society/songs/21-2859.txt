Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
