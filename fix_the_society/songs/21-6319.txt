Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
