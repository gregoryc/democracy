Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
