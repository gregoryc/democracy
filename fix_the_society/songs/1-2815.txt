Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
