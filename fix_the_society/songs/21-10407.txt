Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
