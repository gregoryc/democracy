Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
