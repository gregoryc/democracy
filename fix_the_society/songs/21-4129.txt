Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
