Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
