Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The state of science is, wholly inert

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
