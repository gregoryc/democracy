Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
