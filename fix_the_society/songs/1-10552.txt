Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
