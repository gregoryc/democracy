Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
