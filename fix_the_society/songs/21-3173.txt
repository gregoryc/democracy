Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
