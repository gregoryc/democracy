Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
