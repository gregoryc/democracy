Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
