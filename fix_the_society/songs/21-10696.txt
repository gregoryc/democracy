Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
