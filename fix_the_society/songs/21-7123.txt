Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
