Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
