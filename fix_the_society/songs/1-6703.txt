Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
