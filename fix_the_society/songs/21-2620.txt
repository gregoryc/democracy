Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
