Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
