Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
