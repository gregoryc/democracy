Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
