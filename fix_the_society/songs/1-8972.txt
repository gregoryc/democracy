Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
