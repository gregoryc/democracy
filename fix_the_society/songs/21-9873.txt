Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
