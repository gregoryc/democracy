Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
