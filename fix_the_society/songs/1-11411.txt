Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
