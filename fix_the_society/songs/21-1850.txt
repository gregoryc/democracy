Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
