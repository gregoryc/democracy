VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
No one will be unhurt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
