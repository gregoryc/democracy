Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
