Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
