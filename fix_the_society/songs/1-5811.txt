Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
