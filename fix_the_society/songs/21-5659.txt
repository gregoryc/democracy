Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
