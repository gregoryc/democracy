Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
