Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
