Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
