Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
