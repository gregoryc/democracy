Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
