Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
