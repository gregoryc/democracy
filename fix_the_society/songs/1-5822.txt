Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
