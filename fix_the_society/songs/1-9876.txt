VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
