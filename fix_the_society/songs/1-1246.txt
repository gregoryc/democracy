Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
