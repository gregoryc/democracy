Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
