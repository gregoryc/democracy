VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
