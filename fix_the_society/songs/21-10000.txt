Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
