Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
