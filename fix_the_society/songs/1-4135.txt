Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
