Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
