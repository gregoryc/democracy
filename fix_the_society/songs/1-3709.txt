Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
