Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
