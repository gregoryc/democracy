Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
