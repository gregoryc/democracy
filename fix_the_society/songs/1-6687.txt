Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
