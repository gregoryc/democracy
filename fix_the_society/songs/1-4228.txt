Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
