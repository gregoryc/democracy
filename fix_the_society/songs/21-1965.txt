Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
