Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
