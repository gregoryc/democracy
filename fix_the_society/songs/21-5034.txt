Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
