Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
