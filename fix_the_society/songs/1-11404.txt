Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
