Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
