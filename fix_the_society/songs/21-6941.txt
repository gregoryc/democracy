Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
