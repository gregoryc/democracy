Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
