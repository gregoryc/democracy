Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
