Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
