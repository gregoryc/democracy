Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
