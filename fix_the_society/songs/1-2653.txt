Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
