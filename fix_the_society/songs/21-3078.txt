Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
