Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
