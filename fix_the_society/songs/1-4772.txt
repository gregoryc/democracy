Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
