Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
