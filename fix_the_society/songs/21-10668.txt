Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
