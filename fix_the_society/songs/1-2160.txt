Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
