Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
