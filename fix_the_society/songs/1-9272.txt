Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
