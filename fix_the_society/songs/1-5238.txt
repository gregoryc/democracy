Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
