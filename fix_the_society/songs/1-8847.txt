Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
