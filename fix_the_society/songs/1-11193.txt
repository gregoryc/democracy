Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
