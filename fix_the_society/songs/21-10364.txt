Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
