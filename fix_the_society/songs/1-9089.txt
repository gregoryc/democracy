Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
