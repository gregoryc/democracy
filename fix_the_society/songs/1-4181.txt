Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
