Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
