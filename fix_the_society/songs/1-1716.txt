Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and crying like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
