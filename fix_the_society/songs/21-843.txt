Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
