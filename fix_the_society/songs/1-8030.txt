Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
