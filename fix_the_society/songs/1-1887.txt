Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is plain, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
