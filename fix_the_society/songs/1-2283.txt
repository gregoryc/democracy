Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
