Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
