Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
