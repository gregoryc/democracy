Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
An open conversation, they always divert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
