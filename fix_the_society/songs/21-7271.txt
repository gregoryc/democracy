Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
