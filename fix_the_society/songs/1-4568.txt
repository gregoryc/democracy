Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
