Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
