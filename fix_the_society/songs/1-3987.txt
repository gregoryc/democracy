Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
