Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
