Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
