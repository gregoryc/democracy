Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
