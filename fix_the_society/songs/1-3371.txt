Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
