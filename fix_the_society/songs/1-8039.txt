Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
