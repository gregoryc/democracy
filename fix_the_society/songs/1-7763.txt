Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
