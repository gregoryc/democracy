Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
