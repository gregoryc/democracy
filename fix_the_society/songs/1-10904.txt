Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
