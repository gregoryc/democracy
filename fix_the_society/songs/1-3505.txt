Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
