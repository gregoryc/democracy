Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
