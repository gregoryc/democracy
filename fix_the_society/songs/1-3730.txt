Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
