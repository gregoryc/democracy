Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
