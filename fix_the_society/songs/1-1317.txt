Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
