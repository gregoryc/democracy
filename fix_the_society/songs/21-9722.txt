Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
