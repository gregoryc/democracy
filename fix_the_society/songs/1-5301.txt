Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
