Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
