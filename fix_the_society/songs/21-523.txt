Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
