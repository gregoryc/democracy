Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
