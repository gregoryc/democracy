Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

An open conversation, they always divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
