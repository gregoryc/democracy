Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
