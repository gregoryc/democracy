Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
