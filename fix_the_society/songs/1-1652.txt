Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
