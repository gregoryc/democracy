Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Destruction and doom is what they architect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
