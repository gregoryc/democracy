Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
