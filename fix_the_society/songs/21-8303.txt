Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
