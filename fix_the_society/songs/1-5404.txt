Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
