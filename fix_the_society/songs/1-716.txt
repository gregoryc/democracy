Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
