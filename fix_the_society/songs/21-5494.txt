Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
