Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
