Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
