Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
