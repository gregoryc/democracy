Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
