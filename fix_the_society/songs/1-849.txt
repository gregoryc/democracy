Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
