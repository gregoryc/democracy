Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
