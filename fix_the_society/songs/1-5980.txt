VERSE

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
