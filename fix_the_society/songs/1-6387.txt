VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
