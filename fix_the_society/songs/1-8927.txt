Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
