Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
