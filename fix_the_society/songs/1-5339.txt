Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
