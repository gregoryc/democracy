Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
