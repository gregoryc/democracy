Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
