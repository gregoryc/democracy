Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
