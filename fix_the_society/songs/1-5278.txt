Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
