Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
