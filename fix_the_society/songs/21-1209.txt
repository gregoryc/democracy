Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
