Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
