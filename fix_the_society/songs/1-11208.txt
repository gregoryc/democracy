Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
