Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
