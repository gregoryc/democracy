Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
