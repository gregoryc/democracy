Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
