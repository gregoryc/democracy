Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
