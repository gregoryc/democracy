Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
