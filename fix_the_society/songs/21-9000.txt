Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
