Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
