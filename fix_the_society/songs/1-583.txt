Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
