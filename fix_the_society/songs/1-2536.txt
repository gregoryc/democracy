Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
