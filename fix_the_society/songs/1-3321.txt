Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
