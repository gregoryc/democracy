Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
