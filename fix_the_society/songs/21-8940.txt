Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
