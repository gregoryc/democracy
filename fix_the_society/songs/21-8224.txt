Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
