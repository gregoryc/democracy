Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard

Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
