VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
