Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
