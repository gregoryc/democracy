Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
