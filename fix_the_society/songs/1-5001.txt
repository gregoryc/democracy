Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
