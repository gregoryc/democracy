Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
