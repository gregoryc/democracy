Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
