Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
