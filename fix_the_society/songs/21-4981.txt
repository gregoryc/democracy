Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
