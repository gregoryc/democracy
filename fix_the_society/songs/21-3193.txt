Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
