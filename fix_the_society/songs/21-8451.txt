Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
