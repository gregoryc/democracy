Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
