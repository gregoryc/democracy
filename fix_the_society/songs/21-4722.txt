Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
