Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
