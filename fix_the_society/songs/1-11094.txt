Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
