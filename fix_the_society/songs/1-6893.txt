VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
