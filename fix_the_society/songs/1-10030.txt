Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
