Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
