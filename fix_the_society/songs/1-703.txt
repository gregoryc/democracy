Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
