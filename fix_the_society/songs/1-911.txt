Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
