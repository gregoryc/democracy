Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
