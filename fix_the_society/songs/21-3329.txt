Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
