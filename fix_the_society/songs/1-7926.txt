Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
