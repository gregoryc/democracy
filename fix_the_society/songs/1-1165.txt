VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
