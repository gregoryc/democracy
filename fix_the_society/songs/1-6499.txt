Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
