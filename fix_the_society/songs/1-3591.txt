Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
