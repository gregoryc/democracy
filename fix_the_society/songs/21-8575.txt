Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
