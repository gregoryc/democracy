Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
