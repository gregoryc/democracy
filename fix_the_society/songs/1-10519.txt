Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is too insidious for many to detect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
