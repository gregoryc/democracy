Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
