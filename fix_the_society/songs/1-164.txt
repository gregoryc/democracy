Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
