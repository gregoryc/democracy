Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Reason is what they want to discard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
