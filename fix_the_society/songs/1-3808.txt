Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
