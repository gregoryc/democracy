Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
