Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
