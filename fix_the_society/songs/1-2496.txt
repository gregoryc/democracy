Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
