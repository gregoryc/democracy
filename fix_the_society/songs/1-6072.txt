Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
