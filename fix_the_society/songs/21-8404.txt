Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
