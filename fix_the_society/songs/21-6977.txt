Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
