Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
