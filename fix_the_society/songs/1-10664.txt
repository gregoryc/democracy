Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
