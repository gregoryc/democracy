Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
