Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
