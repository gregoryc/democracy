Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
