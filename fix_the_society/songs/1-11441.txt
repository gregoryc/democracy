Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
