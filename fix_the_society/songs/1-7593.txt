Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
