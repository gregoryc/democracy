Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
