Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
