Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
