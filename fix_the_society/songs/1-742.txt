Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
