Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
