Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
