Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
