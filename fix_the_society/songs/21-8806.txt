Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
