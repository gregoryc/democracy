Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
