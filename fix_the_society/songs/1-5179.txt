Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
