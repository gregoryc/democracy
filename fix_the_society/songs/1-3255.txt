Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
