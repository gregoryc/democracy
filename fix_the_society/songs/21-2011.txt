Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
