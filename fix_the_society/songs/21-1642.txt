Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
