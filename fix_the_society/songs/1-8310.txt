Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
