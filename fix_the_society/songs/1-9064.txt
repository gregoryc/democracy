Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is plain, anyone can detect

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
