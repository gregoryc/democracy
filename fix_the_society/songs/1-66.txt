Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
