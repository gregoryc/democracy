Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
