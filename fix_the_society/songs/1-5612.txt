Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
