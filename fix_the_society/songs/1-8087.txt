Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

The state of science is, wholly inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
