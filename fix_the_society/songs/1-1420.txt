Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is plain, anyone can detect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
