Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
