Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
