Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
