Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
