Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
