Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They do junk, they do dirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
