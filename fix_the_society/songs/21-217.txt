Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
