Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
