Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
