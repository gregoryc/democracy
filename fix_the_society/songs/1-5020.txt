Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
