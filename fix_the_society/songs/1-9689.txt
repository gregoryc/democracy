Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
