Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
