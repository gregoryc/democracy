Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
