Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
