Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
