Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
