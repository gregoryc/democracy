Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
