Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
