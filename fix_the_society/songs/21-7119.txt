Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
