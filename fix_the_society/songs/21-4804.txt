Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
