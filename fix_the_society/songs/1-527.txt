Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
