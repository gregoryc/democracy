Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
