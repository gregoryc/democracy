Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Their minds, they cannot exert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
