Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
