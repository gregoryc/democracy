Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
