Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
