Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
