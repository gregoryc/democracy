Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
