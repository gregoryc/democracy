Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
