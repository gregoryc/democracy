Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
