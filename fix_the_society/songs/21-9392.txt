Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
