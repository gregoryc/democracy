VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
