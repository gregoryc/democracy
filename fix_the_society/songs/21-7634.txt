Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
