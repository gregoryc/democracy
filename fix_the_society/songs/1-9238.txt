Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
