Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
