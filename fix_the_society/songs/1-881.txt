Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
