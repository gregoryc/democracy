Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
