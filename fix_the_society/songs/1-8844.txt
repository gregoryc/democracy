Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
