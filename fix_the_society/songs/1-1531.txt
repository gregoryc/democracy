VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
