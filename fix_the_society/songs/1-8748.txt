Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
