Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
