Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
