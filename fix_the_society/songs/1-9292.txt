Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
