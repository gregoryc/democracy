Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
