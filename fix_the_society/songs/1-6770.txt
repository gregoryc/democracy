Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
