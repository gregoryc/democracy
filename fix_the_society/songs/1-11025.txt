Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
