Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
