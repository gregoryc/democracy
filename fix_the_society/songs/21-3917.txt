Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
