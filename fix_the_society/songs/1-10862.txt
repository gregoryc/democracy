Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
