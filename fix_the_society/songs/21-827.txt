Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
