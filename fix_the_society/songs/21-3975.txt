Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
