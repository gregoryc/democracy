Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
