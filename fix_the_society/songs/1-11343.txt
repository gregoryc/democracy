Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
