Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
