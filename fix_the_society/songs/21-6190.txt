Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
