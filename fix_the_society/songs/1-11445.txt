Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
