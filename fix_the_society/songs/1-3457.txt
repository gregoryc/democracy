Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
