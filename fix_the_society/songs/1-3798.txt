VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
