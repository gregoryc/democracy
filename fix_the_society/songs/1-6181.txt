Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
