Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
