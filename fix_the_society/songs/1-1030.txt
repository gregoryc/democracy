Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
