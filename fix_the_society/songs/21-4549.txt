Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
