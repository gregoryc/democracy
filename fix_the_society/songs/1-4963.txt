Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
