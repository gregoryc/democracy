Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
