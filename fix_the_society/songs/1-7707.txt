Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
