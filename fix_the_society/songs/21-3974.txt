Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
