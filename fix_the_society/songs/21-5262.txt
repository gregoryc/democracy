Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
