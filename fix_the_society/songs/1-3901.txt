Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
