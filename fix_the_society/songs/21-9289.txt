Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
