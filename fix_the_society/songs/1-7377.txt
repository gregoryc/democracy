Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
