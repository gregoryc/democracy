Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
