Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
