Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
