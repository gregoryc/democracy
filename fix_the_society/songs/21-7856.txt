Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
