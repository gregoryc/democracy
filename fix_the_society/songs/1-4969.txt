Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
