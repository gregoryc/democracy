Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
