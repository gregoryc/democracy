Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
