Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
