Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
