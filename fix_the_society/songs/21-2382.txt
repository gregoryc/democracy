Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
