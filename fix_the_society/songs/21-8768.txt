Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
