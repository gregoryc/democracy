Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
