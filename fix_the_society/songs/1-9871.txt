Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

You don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
