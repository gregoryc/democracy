Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
