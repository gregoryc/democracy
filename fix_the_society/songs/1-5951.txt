Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
