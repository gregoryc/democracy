Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
