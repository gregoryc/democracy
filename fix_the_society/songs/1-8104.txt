Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
