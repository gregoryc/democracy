Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
