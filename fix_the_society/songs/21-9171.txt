Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
