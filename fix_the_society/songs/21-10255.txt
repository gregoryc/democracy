Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
