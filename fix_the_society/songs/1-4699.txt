VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
