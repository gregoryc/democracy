Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
