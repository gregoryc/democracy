Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
