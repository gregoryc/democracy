Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too insidious for many to detect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
