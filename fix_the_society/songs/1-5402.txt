Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
