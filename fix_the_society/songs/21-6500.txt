Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
