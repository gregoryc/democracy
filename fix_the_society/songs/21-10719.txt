Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
