Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
