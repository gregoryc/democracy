Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
