Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
