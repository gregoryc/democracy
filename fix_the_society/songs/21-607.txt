Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
