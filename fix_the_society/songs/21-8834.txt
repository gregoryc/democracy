Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
