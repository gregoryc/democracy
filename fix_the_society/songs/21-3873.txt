Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
