Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
