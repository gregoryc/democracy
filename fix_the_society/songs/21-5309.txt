Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
