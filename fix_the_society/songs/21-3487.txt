Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
