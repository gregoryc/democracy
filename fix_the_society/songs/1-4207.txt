Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
