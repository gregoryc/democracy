Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
