Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
