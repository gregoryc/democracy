Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
