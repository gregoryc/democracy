Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
