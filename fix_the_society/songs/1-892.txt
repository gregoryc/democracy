Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
