Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
