Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
