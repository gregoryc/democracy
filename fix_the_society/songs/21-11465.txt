Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
