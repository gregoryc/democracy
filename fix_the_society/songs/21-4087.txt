Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
