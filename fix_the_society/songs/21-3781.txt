Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
