Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
