Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
