Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
