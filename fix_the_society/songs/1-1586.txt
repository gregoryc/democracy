Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
