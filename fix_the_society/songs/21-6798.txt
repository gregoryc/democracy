Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
