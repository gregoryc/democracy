Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
