Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
