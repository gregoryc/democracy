Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
