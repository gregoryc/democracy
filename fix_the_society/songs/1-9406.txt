Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
