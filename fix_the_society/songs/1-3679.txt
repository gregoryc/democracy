Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
