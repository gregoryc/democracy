Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
