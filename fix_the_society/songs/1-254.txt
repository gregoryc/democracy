Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
