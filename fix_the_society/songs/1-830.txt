Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and moaning like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
