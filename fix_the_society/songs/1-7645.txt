Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
