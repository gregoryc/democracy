Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
