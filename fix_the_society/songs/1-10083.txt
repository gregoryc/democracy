Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
