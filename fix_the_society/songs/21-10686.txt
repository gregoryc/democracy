Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
