Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
