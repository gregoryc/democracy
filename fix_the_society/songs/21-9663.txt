Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
