Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
