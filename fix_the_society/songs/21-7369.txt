Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
