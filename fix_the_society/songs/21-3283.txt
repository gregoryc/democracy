Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
