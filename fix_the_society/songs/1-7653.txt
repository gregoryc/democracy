Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
