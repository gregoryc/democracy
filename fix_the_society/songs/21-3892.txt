Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
