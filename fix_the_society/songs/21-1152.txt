Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
