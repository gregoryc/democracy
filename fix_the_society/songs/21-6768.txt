Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
