Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
