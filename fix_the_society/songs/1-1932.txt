Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
