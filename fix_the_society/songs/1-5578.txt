Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
