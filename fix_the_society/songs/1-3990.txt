Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
