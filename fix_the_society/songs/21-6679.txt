Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
