Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
