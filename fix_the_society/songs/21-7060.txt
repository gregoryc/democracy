Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
