Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
