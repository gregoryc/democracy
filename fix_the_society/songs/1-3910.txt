Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
