Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
