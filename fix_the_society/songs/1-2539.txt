Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
