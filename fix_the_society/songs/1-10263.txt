Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
