Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
