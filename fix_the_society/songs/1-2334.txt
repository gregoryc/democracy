Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
I must speak here, I must interject

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
