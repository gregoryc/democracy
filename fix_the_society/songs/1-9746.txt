Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
