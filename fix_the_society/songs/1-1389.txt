Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Not talking isn't going to divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
