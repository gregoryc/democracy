Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
I must speak here, I must interject

They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
