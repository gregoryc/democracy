Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
