Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
