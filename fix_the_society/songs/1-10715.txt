Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
