Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
