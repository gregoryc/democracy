Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
