VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
