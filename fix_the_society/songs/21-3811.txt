Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
