Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
