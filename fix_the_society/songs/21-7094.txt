Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
