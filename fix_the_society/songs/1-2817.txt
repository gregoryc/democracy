Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
