Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
