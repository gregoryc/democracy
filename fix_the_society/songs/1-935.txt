Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
