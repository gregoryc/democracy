Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
