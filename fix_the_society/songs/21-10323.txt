Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
