Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
