Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
