Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
