Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
