Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
