Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
