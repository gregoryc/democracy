Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
