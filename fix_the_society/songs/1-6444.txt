Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
