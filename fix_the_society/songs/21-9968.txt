Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
