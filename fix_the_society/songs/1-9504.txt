Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
