Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
