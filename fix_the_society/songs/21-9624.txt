Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
