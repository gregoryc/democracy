Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
