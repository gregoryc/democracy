Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
