Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
