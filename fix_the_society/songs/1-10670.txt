Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
