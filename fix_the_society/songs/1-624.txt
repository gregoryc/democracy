Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

This is obvious, anyone can detect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
