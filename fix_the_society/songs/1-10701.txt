Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
