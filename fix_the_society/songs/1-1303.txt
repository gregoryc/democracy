Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
