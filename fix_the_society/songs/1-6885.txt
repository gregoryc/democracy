Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
