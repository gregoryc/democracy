Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
