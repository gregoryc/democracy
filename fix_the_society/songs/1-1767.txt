Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
