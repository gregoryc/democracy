Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
