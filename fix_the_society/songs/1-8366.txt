Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
