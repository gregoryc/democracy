Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
