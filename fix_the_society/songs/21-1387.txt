Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
