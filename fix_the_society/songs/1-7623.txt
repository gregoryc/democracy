Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
