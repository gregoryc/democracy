Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
