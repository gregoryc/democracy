Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
