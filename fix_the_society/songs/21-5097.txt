Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
