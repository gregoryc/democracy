Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
