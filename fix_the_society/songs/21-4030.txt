Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
