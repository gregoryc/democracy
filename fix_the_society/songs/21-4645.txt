Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
