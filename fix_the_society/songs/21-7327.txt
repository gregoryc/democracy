Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
