Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
