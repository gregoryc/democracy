Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
