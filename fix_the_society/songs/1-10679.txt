Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
