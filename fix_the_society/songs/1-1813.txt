Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Playing only the worst card

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too insidious for many to detect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
