Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
