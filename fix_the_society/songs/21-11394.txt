Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
