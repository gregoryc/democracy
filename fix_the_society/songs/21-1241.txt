Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
