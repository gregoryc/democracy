Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
