Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
