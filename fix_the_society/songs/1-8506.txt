Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
