Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
