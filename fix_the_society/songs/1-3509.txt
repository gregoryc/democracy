Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
