Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
