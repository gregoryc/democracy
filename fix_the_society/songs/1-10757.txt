Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
