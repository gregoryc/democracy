Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
