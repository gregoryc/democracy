Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
