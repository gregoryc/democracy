Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
