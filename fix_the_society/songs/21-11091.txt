Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
