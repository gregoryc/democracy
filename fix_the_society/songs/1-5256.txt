Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
