Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
