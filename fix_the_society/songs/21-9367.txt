Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
