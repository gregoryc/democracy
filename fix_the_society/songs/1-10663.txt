Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
