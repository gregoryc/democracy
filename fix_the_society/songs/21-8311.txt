Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
