Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
