Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
