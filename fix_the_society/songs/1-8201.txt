VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

I must speak here, I must interject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
