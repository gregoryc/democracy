Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
