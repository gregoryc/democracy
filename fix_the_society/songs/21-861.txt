Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
