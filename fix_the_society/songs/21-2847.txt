Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
