Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
