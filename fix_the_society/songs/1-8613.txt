Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Playing only the worst card

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
