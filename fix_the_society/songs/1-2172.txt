Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
