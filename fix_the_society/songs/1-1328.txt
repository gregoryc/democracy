Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
