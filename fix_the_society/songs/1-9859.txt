VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
