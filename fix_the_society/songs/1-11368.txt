Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
