Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
