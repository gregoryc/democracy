Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
