Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
