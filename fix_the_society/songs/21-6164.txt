Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
