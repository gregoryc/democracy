Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
