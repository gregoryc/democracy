Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
