Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
