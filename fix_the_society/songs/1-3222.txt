Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
