Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
An open conversation, they always divert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
