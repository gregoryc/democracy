Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
