Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
