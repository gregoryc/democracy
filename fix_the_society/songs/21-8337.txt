Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
