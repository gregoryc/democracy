Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
