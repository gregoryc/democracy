VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
