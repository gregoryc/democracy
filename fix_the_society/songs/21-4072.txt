Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
