Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
