Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
