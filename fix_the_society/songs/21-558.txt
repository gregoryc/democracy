Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
