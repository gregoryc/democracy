Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
