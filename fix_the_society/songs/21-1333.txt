Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
