Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
