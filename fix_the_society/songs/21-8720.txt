Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
