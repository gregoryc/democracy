Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
An open conversation, they always divert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
