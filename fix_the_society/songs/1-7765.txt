Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
