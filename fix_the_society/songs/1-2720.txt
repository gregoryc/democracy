Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their own principles are something they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
