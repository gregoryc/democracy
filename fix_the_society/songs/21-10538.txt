Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
