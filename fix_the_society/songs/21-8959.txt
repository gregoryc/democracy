Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
