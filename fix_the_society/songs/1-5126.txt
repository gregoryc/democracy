Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
