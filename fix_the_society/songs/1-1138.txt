Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
