Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
