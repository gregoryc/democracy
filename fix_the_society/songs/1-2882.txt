Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
