Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
