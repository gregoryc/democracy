Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
