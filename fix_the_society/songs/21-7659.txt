Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
