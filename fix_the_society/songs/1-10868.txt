Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
