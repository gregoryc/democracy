Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
