Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
