Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
