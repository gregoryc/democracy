Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
