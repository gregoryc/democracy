VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
