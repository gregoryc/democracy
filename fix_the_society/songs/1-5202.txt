Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
