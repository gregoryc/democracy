Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
