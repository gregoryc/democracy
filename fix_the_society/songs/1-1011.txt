VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
