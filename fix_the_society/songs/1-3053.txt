Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
