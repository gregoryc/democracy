Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They hate themselves, they do not respect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
