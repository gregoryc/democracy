VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
