Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
