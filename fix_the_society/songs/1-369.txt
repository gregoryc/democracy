Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
