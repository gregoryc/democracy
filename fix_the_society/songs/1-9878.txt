Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
