Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
