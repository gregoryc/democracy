Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
