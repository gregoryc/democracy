Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
