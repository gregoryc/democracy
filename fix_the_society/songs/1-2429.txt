Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
