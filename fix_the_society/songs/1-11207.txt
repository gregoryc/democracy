VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
