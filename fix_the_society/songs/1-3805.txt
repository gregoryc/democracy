Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
