Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
