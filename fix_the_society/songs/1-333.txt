Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
