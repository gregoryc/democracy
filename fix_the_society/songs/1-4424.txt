Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
