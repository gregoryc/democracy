Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
