Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
