Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

An open conversation, they always divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
