Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
