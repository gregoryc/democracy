Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
