Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
