Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

An open conversation, they always divert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
