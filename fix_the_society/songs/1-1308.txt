Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
