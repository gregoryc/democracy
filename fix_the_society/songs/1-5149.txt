VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
