Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
