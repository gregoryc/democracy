Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
