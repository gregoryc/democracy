Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
