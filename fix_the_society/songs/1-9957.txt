Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
