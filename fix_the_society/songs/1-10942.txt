Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
