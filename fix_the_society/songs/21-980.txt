Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
