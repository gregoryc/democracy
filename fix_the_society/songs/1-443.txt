Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Playing only the worst card

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
