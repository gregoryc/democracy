Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
