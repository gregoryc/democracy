Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
