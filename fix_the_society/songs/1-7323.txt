Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
The society is the ones who hurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
