Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
