Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
