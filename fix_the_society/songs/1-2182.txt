Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
