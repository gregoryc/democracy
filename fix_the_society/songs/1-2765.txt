Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
