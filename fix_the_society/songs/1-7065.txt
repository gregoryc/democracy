Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
