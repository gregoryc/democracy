Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
