Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is plain, anyone can detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
