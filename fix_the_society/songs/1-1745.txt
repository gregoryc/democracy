Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
