Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
The society itself, you completely neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
