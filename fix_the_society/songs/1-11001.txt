VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
