Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
