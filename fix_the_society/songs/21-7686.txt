Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
