VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
