Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
