Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
