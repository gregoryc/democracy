Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
