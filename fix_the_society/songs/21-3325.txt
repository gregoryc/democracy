Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
