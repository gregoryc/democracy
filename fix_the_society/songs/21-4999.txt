Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
