Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
