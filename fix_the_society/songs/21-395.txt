Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
