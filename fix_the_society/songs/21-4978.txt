Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
