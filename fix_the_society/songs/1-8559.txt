VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
