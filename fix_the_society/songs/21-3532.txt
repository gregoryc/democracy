Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
