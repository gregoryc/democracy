Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Whining and complaining like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
