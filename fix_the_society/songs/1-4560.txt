Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
