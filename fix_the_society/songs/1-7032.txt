Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
