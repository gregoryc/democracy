Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
