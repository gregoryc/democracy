Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
