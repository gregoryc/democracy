Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
