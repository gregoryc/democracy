Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
