Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, you completely neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
