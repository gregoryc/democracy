Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
