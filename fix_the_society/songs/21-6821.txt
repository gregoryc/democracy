Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
