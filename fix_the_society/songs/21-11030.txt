Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS
