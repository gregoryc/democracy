Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
