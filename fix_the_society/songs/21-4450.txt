Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
