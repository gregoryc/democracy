Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
They hate themselves, they do not respect

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
