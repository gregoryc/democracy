Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
