Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
