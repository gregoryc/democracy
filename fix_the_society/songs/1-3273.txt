Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Science is  fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

VERSE

You don't think, you act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
