Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
