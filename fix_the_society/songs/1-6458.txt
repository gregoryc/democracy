Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
