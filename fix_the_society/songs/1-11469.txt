Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
