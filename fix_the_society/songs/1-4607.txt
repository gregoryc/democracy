Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
