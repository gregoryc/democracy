Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
