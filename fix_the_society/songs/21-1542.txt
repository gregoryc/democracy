Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
