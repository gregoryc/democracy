Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
