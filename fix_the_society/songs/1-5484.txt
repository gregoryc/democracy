Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
