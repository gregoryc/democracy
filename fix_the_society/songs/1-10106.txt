Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
