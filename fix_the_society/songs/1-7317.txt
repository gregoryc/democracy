Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
