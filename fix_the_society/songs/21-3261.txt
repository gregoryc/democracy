Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
