Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
