Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
