Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
