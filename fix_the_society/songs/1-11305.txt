Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

The society is the ones who hurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
