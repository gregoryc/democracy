Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
