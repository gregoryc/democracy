Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

All with their clique, eating their dessert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
