Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
