Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
