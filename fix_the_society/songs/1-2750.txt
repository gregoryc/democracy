Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
