Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
