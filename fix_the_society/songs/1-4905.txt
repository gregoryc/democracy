Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
