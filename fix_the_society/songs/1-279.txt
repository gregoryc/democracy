Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
