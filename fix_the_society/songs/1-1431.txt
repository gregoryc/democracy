Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
