Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
