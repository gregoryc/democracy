Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
