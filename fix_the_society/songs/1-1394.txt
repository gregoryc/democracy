Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
