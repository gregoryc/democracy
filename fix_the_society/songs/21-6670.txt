Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
