Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
