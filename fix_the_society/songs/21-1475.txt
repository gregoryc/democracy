Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
