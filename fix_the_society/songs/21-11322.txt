Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
