Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and complaining like a kid

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
