Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
