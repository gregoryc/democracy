Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
