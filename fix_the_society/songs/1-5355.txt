Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
