Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
