Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Whining and moaning like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
