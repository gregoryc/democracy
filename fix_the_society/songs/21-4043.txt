Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
