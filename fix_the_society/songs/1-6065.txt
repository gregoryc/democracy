Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
