Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
