Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

You make broad statements while acting like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
