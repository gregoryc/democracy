Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
