Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
