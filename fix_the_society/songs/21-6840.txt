Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
