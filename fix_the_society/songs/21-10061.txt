Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
