Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
