Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
