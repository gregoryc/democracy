Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
