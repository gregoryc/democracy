Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
