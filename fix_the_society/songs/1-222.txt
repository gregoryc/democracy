Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
