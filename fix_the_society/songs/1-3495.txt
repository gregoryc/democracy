Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
