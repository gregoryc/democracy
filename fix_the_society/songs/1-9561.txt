Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
