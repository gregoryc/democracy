Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Change will come soon, it will come

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
