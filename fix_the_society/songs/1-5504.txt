Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
