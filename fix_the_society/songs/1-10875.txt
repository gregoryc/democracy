Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
