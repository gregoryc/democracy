Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
