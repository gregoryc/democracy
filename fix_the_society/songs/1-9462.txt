Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
