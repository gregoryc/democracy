Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
