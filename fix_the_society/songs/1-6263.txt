Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
