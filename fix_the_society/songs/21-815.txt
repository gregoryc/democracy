Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
