Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
