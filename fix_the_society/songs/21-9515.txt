Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
