Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
