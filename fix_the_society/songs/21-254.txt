Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
