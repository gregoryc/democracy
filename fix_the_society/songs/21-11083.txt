Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
