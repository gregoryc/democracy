Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
