Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
