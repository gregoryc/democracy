Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
