VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
