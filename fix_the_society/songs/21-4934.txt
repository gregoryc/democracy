Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
