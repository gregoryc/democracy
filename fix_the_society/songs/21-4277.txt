Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
