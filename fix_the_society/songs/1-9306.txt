Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
