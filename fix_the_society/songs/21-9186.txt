Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
