VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
