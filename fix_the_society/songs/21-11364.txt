Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
