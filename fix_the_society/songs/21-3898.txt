Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
