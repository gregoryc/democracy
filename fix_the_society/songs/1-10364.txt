Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
