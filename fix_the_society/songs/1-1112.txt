Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
