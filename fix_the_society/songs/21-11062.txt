Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
