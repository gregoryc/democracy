Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
