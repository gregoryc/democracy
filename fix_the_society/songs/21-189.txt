Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
