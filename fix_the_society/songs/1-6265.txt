Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
