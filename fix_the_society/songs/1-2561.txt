VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
