Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
