Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
