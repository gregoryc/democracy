Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
