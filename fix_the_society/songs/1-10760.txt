Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
