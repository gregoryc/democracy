VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
