Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
