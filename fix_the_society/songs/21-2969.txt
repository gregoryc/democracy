Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
