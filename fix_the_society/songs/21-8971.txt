Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
