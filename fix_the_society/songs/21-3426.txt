Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
