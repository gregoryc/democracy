Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
