Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
