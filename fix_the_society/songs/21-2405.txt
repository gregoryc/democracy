Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
