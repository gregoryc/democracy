Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
