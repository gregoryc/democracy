Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
