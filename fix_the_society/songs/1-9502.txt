Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
