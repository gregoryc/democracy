Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
