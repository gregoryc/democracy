Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The society itself, you completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
