Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They always evade, they always run

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
