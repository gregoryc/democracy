Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
