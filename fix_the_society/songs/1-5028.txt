Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The state of science is, wholly inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
