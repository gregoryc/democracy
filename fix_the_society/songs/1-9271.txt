Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
