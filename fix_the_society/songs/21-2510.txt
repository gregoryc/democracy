Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
