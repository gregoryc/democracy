Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
