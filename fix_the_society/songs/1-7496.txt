Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
