Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
