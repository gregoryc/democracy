Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
