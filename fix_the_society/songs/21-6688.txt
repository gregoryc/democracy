Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
