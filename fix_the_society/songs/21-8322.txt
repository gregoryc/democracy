Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
