Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
