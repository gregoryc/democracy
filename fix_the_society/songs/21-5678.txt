Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
