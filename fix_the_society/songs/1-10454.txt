Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
