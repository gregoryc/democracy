VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
