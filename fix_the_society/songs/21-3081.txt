Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
