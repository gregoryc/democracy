Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
