Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
