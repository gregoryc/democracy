Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
