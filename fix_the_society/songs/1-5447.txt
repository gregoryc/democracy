Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
