Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
