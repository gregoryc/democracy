Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
