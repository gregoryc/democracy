Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
