Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
