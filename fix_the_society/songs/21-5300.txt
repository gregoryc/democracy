Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
