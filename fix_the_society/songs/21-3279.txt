Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
