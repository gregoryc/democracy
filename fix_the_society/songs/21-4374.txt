Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
