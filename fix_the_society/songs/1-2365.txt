Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
