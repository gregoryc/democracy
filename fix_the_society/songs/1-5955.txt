Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
