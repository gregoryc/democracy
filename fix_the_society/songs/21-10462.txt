Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
