Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
