Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
