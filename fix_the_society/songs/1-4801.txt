Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
