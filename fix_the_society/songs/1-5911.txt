Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
