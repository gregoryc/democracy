Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
