Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
