Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
