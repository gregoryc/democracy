Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
