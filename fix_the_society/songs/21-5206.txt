Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
