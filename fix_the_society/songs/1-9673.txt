Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
