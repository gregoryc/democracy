Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
