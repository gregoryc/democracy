Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
