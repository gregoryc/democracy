Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
