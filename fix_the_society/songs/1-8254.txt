Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
