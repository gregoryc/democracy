Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
