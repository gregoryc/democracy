Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
