Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
