Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
