Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
