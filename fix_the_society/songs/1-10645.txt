VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
