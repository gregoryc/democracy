Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
