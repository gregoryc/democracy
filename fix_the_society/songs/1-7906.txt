Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
