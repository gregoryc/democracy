Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
