VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
