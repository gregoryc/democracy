Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
