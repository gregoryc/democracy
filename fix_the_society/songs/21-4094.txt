Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
