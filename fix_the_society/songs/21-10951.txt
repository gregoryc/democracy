Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
