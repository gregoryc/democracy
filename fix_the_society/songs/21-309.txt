Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
