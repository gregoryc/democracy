Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
An open conversation, they always divert

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
