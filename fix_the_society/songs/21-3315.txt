Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
