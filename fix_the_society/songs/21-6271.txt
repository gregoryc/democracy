Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
