Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
