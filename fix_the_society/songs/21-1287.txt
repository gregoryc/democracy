Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
