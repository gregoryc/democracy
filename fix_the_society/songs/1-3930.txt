Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
