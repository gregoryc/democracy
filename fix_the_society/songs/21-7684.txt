Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
