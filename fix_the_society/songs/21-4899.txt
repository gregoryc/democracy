Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
