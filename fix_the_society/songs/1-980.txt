Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
