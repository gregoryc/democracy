Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
