Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
