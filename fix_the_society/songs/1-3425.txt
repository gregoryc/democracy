Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
