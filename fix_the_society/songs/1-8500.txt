Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
