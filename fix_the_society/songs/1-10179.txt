Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't think, they act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
