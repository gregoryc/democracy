Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
