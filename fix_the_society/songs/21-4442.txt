Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
