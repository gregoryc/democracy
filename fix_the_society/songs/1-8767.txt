VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
