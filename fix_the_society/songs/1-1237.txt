Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
