Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
