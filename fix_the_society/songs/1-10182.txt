Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
