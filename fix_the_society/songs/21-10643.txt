Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
