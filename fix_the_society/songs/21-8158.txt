Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
