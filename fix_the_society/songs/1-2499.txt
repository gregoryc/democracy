Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
