Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
