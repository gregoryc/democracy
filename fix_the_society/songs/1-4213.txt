Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
