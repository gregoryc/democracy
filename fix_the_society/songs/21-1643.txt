Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
