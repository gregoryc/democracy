Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
