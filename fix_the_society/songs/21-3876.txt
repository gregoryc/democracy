Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
