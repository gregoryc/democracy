Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
