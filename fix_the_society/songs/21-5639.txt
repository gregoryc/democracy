Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
