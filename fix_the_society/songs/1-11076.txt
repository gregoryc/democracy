Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't want to understand, act like a kid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
