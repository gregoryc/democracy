Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
