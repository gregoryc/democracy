Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
