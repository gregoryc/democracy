Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
