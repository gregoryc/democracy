Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
