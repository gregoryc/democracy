Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
