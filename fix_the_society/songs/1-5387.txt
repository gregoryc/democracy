Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
