Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
