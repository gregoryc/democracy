Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS
