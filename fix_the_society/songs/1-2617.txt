Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
