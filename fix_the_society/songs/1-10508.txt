Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
