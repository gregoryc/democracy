VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
