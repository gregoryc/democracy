VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
