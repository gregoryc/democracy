Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
