Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't think, you act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
