Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
