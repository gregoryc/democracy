Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS
