Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

I must speak here, I must interject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
