Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
