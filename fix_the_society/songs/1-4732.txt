VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
