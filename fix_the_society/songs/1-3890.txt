Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Playing only the worst card
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
