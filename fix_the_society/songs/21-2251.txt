Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
