Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They do junk, they do dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
