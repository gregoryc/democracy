Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
