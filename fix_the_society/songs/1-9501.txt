Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
