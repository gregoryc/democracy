Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
