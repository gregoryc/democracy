Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
