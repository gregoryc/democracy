Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Science is  fundamentally inert
