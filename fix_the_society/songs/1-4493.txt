Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
