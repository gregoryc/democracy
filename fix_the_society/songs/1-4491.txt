Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

If you talk to them they miss the subject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
