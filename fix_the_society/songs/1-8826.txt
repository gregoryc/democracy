Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
