Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
