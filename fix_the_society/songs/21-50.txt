Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
