Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
