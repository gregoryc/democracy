Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
