Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
