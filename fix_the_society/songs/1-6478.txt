Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
They do junk, they do dirt

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
