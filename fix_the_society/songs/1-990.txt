Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
