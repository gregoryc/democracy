Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
