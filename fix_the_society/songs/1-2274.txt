Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and complaining like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
