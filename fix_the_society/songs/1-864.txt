Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
