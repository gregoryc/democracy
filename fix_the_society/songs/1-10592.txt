Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They make broad statements while looking like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
