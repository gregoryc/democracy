Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

CHORUS

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
