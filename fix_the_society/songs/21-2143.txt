Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
