Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
