Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
