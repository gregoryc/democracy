Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and crying like a kid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
