VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
