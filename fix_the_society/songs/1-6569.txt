Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
