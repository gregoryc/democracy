Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
