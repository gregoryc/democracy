Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

You don't think, you act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
