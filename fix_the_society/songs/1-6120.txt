Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Away from the truth they hid
Whining and crying like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
