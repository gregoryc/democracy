Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
I must speak here, I must interject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
