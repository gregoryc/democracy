Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
