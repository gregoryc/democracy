VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
