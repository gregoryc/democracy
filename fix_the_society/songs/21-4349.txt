Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
