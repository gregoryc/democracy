Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

The society itself, you completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
