Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
