Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
