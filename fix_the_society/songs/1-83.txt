Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
