Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
