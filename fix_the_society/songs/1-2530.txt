Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
