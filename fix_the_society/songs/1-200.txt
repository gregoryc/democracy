Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
