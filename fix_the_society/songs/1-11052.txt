Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
