Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
