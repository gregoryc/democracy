Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
