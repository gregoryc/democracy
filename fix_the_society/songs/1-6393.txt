Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
