Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
