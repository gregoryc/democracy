Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
