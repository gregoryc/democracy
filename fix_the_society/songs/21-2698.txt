Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
