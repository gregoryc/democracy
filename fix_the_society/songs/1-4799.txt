Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
