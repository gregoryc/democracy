Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
