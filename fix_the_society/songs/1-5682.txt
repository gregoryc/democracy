Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
