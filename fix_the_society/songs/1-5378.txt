Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This is plain, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Away from the truth they hid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
