Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Inert science they consecrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
