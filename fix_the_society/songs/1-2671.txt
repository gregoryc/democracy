VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and crying like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
