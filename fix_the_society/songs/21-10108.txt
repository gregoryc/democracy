Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
