Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
