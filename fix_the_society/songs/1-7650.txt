VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
