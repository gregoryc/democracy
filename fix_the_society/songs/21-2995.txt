Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Inert science they consecrate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
