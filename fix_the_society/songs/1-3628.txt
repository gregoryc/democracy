Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
