Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
