Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
