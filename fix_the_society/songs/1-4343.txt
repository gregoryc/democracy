Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
