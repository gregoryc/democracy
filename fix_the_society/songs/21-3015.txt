Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
