Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
