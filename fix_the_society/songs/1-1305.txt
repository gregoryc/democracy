Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
