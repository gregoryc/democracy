Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
