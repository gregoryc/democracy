Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
