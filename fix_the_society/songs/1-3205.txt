Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
