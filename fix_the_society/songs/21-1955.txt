Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
