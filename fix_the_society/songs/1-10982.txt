VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
