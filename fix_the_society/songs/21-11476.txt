Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
