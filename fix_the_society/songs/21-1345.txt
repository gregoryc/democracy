Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
