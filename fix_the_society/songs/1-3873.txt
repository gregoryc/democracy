Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
