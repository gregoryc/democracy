Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
