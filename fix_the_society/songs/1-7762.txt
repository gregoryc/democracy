Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
