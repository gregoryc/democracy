VERSE

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
