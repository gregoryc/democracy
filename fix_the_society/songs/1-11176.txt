Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS
