Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
