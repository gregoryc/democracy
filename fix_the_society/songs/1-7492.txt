Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
