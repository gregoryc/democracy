Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
