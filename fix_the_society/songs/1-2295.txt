Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, they act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
