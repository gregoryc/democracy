Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
