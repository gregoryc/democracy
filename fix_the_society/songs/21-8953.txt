Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
