Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
