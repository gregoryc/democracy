VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
