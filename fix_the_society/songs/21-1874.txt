Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
