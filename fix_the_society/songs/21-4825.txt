Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
