Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
