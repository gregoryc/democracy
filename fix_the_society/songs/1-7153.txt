Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
I must speak here, I must interject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
