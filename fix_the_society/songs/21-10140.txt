Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
