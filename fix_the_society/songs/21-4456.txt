Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
