Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
