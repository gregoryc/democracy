Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
