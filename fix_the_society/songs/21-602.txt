Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
