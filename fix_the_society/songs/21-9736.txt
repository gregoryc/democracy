Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
