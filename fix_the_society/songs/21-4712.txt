Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
