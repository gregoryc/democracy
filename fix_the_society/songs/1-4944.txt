Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
