VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
