Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
