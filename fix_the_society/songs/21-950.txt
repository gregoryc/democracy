Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
