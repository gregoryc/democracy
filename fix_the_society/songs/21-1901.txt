Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
