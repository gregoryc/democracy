Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
