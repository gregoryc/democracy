Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
