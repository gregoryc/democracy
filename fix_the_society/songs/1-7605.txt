Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
