Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
