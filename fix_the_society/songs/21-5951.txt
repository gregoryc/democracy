Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
