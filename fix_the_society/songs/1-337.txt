Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
