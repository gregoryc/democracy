Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
