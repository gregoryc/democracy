Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
