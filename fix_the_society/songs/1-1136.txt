VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
