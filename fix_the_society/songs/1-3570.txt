Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
