Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
