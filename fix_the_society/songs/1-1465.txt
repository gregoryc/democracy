Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
