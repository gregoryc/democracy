Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
