Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

The society is the ones who hurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Whining and complaining like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
