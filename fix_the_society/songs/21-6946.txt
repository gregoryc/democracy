Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
