Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
