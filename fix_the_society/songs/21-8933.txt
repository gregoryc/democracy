Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
