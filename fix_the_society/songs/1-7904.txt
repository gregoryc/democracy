Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
I must speak here, I must interject
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
