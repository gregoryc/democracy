Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
