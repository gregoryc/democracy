Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
