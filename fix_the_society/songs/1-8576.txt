VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
