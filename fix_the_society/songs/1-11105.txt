Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
