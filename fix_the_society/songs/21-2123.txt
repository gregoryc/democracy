Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
