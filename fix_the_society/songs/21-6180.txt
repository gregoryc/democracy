Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
