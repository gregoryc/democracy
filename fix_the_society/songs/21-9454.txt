Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
