Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
