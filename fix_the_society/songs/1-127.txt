Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
