Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
