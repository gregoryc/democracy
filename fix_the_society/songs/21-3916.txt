Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
