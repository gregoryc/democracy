Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
