Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
