Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
