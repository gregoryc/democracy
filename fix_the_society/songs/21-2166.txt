Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
