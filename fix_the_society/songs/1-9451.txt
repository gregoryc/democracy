VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
