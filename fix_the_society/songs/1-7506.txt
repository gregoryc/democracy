Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
