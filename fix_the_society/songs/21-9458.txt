Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
