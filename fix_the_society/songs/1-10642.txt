Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
