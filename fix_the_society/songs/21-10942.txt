Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
