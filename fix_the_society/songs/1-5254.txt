Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
