Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
