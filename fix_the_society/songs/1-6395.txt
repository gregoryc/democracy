Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't think, you act like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
