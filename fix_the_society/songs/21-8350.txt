Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
