Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
