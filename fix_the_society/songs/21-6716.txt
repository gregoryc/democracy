Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
