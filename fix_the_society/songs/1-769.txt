Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, they completely neglect

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Whining and complaining like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
