Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
