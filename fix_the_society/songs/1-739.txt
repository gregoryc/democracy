Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
