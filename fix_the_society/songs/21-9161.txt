Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
