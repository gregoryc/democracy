Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
