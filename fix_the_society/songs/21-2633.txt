Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
