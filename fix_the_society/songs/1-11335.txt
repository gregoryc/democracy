Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The state of science is, wholly inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
