Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
