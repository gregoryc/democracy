Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
