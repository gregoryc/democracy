Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
