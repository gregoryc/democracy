Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
