Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
