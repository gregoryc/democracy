Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
