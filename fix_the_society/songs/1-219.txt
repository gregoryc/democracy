Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
