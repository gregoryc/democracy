Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
