Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
