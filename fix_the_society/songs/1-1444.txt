Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Reason is what they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
