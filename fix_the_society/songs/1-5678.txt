Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
