Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
