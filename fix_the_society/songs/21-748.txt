Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
