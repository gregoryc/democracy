Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
