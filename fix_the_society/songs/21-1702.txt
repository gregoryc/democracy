Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
