Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
