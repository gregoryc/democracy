Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is too insidious for many to detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
