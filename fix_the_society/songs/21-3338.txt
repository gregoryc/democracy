Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
