Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
