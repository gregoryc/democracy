Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Reason is what they want to discard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
