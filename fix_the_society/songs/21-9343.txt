Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
