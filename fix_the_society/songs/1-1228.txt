Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

An open conversation, they always divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
