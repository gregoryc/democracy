Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
