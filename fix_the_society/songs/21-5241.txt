Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
