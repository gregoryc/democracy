Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
