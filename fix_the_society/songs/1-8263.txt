Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
