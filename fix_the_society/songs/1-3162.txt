Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
