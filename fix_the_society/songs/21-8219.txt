Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
