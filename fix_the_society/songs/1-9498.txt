Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
