Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
