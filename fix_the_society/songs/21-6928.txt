Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
