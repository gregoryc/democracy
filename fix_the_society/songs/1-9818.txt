Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
