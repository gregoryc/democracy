Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave

CHORUS

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
