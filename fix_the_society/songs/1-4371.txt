Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They do junk, they do dirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
