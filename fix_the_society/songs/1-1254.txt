Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
