Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt

They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
