Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
