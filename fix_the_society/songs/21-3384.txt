Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
