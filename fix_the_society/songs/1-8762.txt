Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is plain, anyone can detect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
