Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
