Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
