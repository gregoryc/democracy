Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
I must speak here, I must interject

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
