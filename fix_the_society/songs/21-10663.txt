Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
