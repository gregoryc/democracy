Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
