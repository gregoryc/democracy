Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
