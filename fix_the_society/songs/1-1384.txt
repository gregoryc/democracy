Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
