VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
