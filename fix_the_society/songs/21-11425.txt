Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
