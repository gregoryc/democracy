Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
