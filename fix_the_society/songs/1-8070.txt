Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
