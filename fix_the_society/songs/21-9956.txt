Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
