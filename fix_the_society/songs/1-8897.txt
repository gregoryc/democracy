VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
