Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
