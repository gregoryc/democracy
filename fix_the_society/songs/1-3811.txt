Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

CHORUS

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
