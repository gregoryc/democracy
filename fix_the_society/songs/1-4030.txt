Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
