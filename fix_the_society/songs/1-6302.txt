Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
