Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
