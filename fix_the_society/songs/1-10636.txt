Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
