Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

They do junk, they do dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
