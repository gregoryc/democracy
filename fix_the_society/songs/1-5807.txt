Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
