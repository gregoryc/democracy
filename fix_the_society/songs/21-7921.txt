Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
