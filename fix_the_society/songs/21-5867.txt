Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
