Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and crying like a kid

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
