Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

The truth is what they wish to disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
