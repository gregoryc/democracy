Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

The society itself, they completely neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

No one will be unhurt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their minds, they cannot exert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
