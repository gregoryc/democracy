Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
