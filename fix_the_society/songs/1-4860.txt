Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
