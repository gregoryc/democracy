Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
