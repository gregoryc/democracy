Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Playing only the worst card
