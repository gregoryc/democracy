Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Same ideology to the grave

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
