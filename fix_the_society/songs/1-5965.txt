Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
