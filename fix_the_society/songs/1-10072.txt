Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
