Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
