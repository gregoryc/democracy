Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
