Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
