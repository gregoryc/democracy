Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
