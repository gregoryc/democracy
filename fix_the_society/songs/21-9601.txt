Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
