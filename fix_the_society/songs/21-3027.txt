Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
