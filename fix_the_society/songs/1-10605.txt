Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They make broad statements while looking like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
