Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
