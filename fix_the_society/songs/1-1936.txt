Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
An open conversation, they always divert

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The society itself, they completely neglect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
