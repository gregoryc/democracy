Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

The society itself, you completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

Away from the truth they hid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
