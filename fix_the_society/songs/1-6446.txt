Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
