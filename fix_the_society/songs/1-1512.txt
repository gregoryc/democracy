Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The society itself, you completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
I must speak here, I must interject

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Quite introverted, not an extrovert

The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
