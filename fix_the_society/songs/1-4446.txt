Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave

Science is  fundamentally inert
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
