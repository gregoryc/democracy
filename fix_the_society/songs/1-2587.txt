Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and complaining like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
