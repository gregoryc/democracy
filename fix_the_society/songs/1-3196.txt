Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
