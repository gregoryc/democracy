Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
