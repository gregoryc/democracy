Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
