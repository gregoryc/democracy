Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
