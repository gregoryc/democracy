Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
I must speak here, I must interject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You don't think, you act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
