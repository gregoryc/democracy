Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Reason is what they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
