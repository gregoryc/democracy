Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their behavior makes them charred

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
