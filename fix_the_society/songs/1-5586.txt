VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
