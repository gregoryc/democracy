Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
