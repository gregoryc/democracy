Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
