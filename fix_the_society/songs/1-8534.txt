Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't think, you act like a kid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
