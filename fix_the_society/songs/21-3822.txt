Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
