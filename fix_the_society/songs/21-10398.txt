Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
