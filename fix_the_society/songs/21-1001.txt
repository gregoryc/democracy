Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
