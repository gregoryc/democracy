Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They make broad claims while looking like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
