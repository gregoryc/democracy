Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The society itself, you completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
