VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
