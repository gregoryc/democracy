Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
I must speak here, I must interject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
I must speak here, I must interject

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, you act like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

VERSE

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
