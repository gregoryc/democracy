Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
