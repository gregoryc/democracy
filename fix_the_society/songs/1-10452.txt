Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The state of science is, wholly inert

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
