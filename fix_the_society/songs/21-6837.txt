Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
