Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
