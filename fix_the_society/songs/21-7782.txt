Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
