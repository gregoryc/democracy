Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
