Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

You make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
