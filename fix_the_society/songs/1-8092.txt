Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
