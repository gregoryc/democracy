Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
