Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
