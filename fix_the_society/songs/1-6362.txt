Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The society itself, they completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
