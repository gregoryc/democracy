Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
