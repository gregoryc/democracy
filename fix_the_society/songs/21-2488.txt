Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
