Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
