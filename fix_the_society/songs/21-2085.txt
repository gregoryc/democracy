Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

VERSE

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
