Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
