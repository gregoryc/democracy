Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Among their insular cliques they congregate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
