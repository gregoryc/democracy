Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

CHORUS

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
