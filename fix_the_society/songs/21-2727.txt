Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
