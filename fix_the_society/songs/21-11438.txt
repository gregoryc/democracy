Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
