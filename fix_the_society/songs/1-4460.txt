Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
