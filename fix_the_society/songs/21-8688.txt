Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
