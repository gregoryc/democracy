Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

I must speak here, I must interject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
