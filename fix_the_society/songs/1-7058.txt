Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
