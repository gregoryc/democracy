Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They make broad claims while acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
