Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
