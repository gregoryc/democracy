Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
