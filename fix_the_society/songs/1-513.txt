Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
