Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
