Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get into, act just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
I must speak here, I must interject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, they completely neglect
