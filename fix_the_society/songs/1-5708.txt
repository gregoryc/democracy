Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
