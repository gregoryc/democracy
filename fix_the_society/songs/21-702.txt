Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
