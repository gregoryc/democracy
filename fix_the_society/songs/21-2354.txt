Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
