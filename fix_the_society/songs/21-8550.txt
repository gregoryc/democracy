Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
