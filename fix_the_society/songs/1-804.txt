Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
