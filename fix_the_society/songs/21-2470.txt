Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Inert science they consecrate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
