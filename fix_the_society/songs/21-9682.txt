Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
