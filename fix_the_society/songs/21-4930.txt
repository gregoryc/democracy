Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
