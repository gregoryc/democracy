Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't think, you act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
