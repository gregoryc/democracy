Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
