Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
