VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
