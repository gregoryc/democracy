Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
