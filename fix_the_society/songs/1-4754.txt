Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
