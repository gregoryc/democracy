Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
No one will be unhurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
