Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
