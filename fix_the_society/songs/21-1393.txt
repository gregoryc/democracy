Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
