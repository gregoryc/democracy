Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
The society is the ones who hurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
