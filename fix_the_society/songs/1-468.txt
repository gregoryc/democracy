VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
