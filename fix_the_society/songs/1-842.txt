Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
