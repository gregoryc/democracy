Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
