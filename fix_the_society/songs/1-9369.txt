Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
