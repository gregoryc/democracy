Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Inert science they consecrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
