Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
