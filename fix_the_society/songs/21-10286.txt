Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
