Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
