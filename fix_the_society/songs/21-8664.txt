Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
