Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
