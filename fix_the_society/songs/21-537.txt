Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
