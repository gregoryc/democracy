Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
