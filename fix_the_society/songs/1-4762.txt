Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
