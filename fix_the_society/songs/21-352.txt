Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
