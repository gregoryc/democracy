Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The world is the thing they cannot save
The society, they make their slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
