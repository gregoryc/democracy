Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Their own principles are something they do not respect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
