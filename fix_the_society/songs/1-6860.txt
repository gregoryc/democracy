Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
