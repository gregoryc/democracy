Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

CHORUS

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

The state of science is, wholly inert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
