Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
