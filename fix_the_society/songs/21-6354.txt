Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
