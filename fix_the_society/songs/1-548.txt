VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
