Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

You already claim to "know", they just blurt
An open conversation, they always divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
