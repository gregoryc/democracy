Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
