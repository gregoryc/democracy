Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
