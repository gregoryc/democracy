Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
