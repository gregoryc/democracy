Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is plain, anyone can detect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
