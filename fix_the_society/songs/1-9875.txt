Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
An open conversation, they always divert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
