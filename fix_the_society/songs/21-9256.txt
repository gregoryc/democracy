Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
