Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Inert science they consecrate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
