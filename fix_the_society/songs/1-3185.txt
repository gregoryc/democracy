Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is plain, anyone can detect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, they completely neglect

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is plain, anyone can detect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The society is the ones who hurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Not talking isn't going to divert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
