Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
