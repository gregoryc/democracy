Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
