Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
