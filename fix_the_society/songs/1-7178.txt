Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because you don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
