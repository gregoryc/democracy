Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
