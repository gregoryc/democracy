Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
