Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
