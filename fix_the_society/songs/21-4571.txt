Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
