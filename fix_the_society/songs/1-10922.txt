Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
