Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
The state of science is, wholly inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The society, they make their slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
