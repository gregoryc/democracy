Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
