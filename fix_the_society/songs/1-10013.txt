Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
