Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
