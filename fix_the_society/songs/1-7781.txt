VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
