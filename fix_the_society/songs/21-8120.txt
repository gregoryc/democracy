Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
