Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
