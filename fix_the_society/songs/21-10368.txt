Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Change will come soon, it will come

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
