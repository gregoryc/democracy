Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Inert science they consecrate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Among their insular cliques they congregate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
