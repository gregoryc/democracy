VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
