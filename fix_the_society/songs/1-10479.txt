Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Destruction and doom is what they architect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They do junk, they do dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

CHORUS

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
