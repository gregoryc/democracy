Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
