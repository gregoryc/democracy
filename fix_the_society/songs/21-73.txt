Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
