Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
