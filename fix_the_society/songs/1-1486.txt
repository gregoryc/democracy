Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
