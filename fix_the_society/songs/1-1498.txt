Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
