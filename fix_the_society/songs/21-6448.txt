Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
