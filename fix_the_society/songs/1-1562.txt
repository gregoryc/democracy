VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

CHORUS

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
