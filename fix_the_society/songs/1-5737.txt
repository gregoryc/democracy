Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
No one will be unhurt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Their own principles are something they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
