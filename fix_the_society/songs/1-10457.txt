Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
No one will be unhurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The society, they make their slave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
