Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
