Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
