Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
