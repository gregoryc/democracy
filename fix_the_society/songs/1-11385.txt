Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
