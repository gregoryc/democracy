Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid

They act like a retard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
