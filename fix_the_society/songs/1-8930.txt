Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
I must speak here, I must interject

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Whining and crying like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Playing only the worst card
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
