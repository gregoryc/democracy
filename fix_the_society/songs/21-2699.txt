Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
