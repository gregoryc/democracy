Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to get involved, act just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
