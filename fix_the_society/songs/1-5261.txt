VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, they completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
