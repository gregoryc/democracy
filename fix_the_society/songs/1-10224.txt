Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
