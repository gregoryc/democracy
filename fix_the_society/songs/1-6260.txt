Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
