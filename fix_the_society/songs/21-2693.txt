Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Inert science they consecrate
