VERSE

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

VERSE

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
