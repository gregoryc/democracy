Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
