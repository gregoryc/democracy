Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
