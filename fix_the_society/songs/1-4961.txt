Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

No one will be unhurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
