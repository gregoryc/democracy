Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
