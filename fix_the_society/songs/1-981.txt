Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
