Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
