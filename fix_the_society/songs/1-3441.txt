Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
