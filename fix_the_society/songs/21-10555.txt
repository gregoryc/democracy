Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
