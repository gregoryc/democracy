Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society itself, they completely neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
The state of science is, wholly inert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
