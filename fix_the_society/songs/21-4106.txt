Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
