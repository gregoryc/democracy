Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Same ideology to the grave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The society, they make their slave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
