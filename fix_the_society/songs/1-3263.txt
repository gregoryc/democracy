Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
