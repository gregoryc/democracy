Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
