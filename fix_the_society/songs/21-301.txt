Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
