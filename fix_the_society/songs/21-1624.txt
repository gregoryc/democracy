Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
