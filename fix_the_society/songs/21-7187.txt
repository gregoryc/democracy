Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
