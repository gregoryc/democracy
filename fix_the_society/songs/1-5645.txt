VERSE

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
The society is the ones who hurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
