Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad claims while behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt
The society is the ones who hurt
