Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
