Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
