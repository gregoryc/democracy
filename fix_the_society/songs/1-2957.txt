Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of testing, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

VERSE

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They do junk, they do dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
