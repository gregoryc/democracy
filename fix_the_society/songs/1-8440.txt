Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Not talking isn't going to divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
