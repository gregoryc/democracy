Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
