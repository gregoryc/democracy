Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The society itself, they completely neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
