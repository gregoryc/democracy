Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Evading conversation just like a kid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
