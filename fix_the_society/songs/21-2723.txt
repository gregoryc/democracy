Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
