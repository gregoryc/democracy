Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
