Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

To human ideals, you don't want to connect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
