Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
