Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
