Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
