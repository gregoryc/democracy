Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
