Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
No one will be unhurt

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The society itself, they completely neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
If you talk to them they miss the subject
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is wholesale, in every aspect

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
