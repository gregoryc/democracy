Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

If you talk to them they miss the subject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
