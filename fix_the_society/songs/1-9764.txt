Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
The state of science is, wholly inert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
