Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
I must speak here, I must interject

VERSE

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The society itself, they completely neglect

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
I must speak here, I must interject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
