VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
