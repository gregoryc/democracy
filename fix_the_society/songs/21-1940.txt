Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
