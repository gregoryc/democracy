Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
