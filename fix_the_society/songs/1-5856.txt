Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Whining and moaning like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
