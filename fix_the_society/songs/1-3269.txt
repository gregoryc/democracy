Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Reason is what they want to discard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
