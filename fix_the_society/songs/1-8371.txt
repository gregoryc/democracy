Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

CHORUS

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
