Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
