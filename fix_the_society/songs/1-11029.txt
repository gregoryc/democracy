Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
