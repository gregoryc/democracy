Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
