Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Any novel idea, they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
