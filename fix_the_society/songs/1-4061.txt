Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard

This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is too insidious for many to detect

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
