VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
