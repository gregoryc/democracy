Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Science is  fundamentally inert
Their minds, they cannot exert
