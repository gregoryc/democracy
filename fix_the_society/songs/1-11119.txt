Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

You don't think, they act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
