Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
The society is the ones who hurt

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
