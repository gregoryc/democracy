VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
