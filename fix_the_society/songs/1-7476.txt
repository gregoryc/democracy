Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to inquire, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

CHORUS

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
