Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
