Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
