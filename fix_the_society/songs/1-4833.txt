Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The society, they make their slave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
