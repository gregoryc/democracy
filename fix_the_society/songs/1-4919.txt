Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Playing only the worst card

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect

VERSE

The society itself, you completely neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
