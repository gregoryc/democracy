Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
