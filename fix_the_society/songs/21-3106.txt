Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
