Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is obvious, anyone can detect
