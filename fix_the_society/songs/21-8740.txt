Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Inert science they consecrate
