Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't talk so they just succumb

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
