Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
