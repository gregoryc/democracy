Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
