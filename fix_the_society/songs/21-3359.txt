Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
