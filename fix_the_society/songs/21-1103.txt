Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
