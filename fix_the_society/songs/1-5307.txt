Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
