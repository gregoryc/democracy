Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
