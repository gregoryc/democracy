Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
