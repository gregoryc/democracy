Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

An open conversation, they always divert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
They do junk, they do dirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
