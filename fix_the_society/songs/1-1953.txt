Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior makes them charred
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
