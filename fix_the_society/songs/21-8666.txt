Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
