Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
