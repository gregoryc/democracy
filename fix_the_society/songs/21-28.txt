Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
