VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
