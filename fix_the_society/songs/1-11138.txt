Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
