Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
