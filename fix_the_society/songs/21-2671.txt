Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

CHORUS

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
