Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Reason is what they want to discard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
