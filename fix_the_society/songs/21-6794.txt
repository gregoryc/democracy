Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
