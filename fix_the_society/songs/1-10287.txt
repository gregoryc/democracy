Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

This is too insidious for many to detect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
