Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
