Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
You make broad claims while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
