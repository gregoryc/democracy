Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Their behavior makes them charred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their minds, they cannot exert

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Playing only the worst card
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
