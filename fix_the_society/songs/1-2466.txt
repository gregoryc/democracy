Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

VERSE

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, they don't want to connect

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
