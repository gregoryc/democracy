Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
