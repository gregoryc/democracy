Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
