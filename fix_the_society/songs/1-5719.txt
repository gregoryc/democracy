Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Playing only the worst card

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
