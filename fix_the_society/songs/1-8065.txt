Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They do junk, they do dirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
An open conversation, they always divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
