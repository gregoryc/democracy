VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

An open conversation, they always divert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
