Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
