VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
