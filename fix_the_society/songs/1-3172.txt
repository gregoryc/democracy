Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
This negligence is poison, the mainstream they infect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
If you talk to them they miss the subject

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
