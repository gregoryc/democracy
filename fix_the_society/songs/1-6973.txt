Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They do junk, they do dirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
