Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Science is in truth fundamentally inert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They do junk, they do dirt

Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their minds, they cannot exert
Science is  fundamentally inert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
