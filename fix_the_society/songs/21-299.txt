Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
