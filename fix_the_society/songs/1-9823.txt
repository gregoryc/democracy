VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
