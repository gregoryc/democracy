Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
