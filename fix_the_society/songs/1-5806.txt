Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
