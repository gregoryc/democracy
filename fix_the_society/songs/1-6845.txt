Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
