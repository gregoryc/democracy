Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
