Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

CHORUS

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
