Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
