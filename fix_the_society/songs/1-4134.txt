Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
