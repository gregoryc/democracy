Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

VERSE

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
