Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Destruction and doom is what they architect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
