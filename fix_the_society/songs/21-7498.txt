Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
