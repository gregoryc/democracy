Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

The society, they make their slave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The society, they make their slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
