Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, they completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
