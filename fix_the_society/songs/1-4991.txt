Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
