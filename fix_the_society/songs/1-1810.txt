Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
The society is the ones who hurt

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
