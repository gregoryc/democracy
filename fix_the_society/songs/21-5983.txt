Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
