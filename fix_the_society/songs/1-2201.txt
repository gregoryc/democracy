Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
An open conversation, they always divert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The society itself, you completely neglect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
