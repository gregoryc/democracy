Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
