Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Playing only the worst card
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The world is the thing they cannot save
