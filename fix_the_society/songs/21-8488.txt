Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
