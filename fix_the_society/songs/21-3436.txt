Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
