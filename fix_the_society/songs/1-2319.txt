Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

They make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

CHORUS

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their own principles are something they do not respect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
