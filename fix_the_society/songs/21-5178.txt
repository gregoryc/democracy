Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
