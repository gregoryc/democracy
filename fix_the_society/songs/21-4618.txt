Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
