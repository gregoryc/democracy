Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
