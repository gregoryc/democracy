Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

You make broad statements while behaving like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Playing only the worst card
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
