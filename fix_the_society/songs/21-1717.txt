Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
