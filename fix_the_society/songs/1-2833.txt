Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
The truth is what they wish to disregard

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert

VERSE

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
