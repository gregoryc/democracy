VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
