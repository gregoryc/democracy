Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
