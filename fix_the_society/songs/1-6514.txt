VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

Not talking isn't going to divert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

CHORUS

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Reason is what they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
