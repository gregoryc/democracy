Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

CHORUS

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Whining and complaining like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
