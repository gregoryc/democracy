Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
You make broad statements while looking like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They hate themselves, they do not respect
