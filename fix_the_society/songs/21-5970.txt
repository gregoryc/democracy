Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
