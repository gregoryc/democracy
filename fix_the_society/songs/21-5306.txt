Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
