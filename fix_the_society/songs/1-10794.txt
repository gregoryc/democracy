Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The society itself, you completely neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
