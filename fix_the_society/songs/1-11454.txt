Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
