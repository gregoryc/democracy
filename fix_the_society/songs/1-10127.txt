Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They do junk, they do dirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The breadth of their claims is lacking, no one is alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
