Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
