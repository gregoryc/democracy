Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

CHORUS

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The society itself, they completely neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
