Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
