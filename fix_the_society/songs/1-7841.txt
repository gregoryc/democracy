Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The society, they make their slave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Same ideology to the grave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
