Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They act like a retard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They don't think, they act like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
