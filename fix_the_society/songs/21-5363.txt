Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Inert science they consecrate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
