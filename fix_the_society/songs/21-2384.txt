Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
