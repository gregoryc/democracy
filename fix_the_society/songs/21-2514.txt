Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
