VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Hive-mind, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
