Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
