Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
The society, they make their slave

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They do junk, they do dirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
