Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The society, they make their slave

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

CHORUS

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is too insidious for many to detect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
