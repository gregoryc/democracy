Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
