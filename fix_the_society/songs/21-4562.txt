Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
