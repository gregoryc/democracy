Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their minds, they cannot exert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Reason is what they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
