Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
