Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Their integrity is zero, they only misdirect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
The society itself, they completely neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
