Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
