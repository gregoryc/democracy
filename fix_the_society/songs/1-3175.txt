Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
The society is the ones who hurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

CHORUS

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is plain, anyone can detect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
