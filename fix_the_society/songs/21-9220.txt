Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

Inert science they consecrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
