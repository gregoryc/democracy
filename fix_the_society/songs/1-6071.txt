Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid

The society itself, you completely neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
