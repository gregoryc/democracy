Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Playing only the worst card
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Playing only the worst card
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Playing only the worst card

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

Evading conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
