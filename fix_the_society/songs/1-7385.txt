Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Not talking isn't going to divert
The state of science is, wholly inert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

CHORUS

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave

VERSE

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

All with their clique, eating their dessert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
