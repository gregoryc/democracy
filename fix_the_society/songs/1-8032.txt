Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The state of science is, wholly inert

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

I must speak here, I must interject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
