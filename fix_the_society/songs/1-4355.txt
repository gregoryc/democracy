Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Away from the truth they hid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't have to do with ego or id
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Same ideology to the grave
The society, they make their slave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
