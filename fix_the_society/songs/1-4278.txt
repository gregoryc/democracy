Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
I must speak here, I must interject

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is obvious, anyone can detect
The society itself, you completely neglect

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
