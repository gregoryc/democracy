Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Inert science they consecrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

Protesting your problems will make you best
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
