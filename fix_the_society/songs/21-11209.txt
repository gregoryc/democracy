Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

CHORUS

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
