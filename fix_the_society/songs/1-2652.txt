Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

The society itself, you completely neglect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
I must speak here, I must interject
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Playing only the worst card

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
