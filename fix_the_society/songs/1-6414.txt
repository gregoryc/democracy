Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The society, they make their slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Hiding away, just like in a cave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
