Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
