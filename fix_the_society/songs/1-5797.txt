Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid

CHORUS

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

Destruction and doom is what they architect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
