Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

CHORUS

Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
Not talking isn't going to divert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
