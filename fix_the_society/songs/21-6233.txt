Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
