Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
