Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Playing only the worst card
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Their behavior makes them charred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
