VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

CHORUS

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They act like a retard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior makes them charred

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard

No one will be unhurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
