Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is obvious, anyone can detect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Destruction and doom is what they architect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They hate themselves, they do not respect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
