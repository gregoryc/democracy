Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

VERSE

We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

Change will come soon, it will come

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
