Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Playing only the worst card

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

This is plain, anyone can detect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
