Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come

You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
