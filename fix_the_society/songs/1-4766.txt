Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

This is wholesale, in every aspect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
The society itself, you completely neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
