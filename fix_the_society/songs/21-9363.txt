Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Protesting your problems will make you best
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
