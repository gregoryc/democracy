Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They can't alter anything, they are inert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

CHORUS

They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Any novel idea, they want to discard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
