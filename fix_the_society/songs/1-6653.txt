Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
Their own principles are something they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

VERSE

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
War and superstition is something they want to resurrect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
