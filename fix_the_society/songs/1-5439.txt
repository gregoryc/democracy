Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The society, they make their slave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
