Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

CHORUS

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
