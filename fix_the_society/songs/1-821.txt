Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
Science is  fundamentally inert
An open conversation, they always divert

CHORUS

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
