Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
The society is the ones who hurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
