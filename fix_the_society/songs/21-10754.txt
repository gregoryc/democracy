Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
