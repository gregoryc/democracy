Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
