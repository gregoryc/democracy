Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
