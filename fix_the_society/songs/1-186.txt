Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Whining and crying like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard
Their behavior makes them charred

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

VERSE

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
The society is the ones who hurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
