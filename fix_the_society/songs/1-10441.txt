Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

CHORUS

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Science is  fundamentally inert

Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
