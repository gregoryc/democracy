Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
