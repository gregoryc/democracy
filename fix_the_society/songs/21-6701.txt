Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
