Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Running away from conversation just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
