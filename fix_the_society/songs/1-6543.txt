Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
The society itself, you completely neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard

VERSE

They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Evading conversation just like a kid

Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
