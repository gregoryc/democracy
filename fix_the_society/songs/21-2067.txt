Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Inert science they consecrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
