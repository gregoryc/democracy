Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

I must speak here, I must interject
The society itself, they completely neglect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

CHORUS

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
