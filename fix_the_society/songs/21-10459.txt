Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
