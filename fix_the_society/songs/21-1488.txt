Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
