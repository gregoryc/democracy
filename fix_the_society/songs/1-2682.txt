Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is not good at all, this is not fun

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

VERSE

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

CHORUS

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
