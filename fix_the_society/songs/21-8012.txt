Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Protesting your problems will make you best
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
