Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The society itself, you completely neglect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

Animalism is something they want to resurrect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This negligence is poison, the lost they infect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

This is too insidious for many to detect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

VERSE

Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
