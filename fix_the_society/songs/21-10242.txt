Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't talk so they just succumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Change will come soon, it will come
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

CHORUS

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
