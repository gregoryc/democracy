VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They walk down the Loser boulevard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Playing only the worst card
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Don't have to do with ego or id
They don't think, they act like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid

The world is the thing they cannot save
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
No one will be unhurt

Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
