Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

VERSE

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
