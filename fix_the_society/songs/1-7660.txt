Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They walk down the Loser boulevard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

The society itself, they completely neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Evading conversation just like a kid

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
