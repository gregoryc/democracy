Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Change will come soon, it will come

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
