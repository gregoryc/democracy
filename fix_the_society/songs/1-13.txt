Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They do junk, they do dirt
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard

The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't see other sides, talk like a kid
