Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
An open conversation, they always divert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
