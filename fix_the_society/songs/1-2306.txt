Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

The truth is what they wish to disregard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
