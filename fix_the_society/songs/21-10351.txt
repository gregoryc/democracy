Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

CHORUS

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
