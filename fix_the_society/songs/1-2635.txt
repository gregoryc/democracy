Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
The society itself, you completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt

CHORUS

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They don't think, you act like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
The world is the thing they cannot save

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, you completely neglect
This is too insidious for many to detect
