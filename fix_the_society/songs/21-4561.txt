Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Protesting your problems will make you best
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
