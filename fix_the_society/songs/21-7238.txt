Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Among their insular cliques they congregate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Protesting your problems will make you best
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
