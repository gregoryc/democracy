Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

CHORUS

They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
