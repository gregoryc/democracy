Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Whining and throwing a tantrum like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

If you talk to them they miss the subject
The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
No one will be unhurt
