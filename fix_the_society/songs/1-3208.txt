Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
No one will be unhurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Reason is what they want to discard
