Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed

CHORUS

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
