VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Reason is what they want to discard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
No one will be unhurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

VERSE

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
I must speak here, I must interject
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
No one will be unhurt
