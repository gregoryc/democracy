Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

VERSE

There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
They don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
