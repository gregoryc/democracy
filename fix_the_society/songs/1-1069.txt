Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard

Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The society is the ones who hurt

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
Playing only the worst card
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
They do junk, they do dirt
Their minds, they cannot exert

The society is the ones who hurt
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their acceptance of the finer things in life, is down in the dirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
