Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

CHORUS

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
