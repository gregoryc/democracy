Name the song or poem as you wish, resell it, but please positively influence culture

Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

CHORUS

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Don't want to test, act just like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
The society itself, you completely neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Running away from conversation just like a kid

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
