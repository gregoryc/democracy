Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
Inert science they consecrate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to talk, with all your might

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
