Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

CHORUS

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
