Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They already claim to "know", they just blurt
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

VERSE

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Same ideology to the grave
