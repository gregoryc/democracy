Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Change will come soon, it will come
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
