VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Same ideology to the grave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

CHORUS

When their are old norms of negligence, how could one be alert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
They do junk, they do dirt

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Running away from conversation just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
