Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

VERSE

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
