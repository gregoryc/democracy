Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
