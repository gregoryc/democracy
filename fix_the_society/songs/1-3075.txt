Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is plain, anyone can detect

They act like a retard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Their behavior makes them charred
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Reason is what they want to discard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Playing only the worst card
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
