Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Inert science they consecrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Change will come soon, it will come
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
