Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to talk, with all your might

VERSE

They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
