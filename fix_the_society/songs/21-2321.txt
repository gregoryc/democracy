Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

CHORUS

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
