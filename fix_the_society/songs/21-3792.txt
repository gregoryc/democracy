Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed

VERSE

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
