Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Same ideology to the grave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

CHORUS

Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Change is now coming, they cannot avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The society itself, they completely neglect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
