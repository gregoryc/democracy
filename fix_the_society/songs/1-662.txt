Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Not talking isn't going to divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
