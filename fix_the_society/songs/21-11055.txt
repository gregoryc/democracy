Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

CHORUS

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
