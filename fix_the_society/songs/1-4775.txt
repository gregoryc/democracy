Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They act like a retard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Reason is what they want to discard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

VERSE

I must speak here, I must interject
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
