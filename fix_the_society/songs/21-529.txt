Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to talk, with all your might
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

VERSE

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
