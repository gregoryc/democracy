Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
An open conversation, they always divert

Playing only the worst card
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard

CHORUS

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They act like a retard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Reason is what they want to discard

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Evading conversation just like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
