Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

VERSE

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
