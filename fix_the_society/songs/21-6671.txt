Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
