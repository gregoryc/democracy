Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

VERSE

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
