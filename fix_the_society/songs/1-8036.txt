Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

CHORUS

They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
The society itself, you completely neglect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They act like a retard
