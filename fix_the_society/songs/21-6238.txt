Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't talk so they just succumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
