Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
