Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right

Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
