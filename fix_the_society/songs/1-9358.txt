Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
This needs to be called out, one should be direct
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

An open conversation, they always divert
No one will be unhurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
