Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

Away from the truth they hid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Unthinkingly narrow-minded, acting just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Change is now coming, they cannot avert

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

No one will be unhurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

VERSE

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
