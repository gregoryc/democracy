Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

VERSE

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Among their insular cliques they congregate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
