Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
The society itself, they completely neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, don't want to properly direct
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
