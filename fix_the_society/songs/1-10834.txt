Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The society itself, they completely neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

All with their clique, eating their dessert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

VERSE

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
