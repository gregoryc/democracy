Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best

They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
