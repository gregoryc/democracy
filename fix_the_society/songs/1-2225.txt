Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Same ideology to the grave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
The society is the ones who hurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
