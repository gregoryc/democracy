Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
