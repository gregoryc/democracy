Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't talk so they just succumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

CHORUS

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
