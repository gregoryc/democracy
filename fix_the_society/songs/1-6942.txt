Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Narrow mind, truth narrowness, acting like a kid

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
This is too insidious for many to detect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct

CHORUS

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Their minds, they cannot exert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect

Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

VERSE

The society, they make their slave
Same ideology to the grave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
