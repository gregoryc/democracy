Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

No one will be unhurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert

They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

One should bring about change, one can see the effect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
They act like a retard

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
