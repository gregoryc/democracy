Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
This is plain, anyone can detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They act like a retard
Reason is what they want to discard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

An open conversation, they always divert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't treat others with dignity, they don't have respect
