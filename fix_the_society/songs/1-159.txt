Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Their behavior makes them charred
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
Preordained, they already know their fave

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Modesty and humility, they never gave

The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
