Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Protesting your problems will make you best

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
