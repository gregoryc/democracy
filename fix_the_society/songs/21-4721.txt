Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

CHORUS

Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

VERSE

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
