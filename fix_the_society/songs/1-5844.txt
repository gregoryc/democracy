VERSE

Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

Having an open mind, should not be so hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
Their acceptance of the truth, is down in the dirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

CHORUS

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior makes them charred
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

VERSE

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
COVID doesn't matter, it's other lies they inject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
