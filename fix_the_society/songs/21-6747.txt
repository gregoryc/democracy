Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
It's important to communicate, with all your might

CHORUS

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

VERSE

Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
