Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Their behavior makes them charred
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Preordained, they already know their fave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Hiding away, just like in a cave

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention

VERSE

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
