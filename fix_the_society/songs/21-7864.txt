Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
If you don't talk to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

CHORUS

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
