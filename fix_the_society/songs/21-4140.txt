Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't communicate is definitely a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Change will come soon, it will come
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Inert science they consecrate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

VERSE

It's important to communicate, with all your might
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

CHORUS

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
