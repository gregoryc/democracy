Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They act like a retard

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Playing only the worst card
Don't care about anyone, they have no regard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

CHORUS

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

VERSE

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
Destruction and doom is what they architect
The society itself, you completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect

Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an adult the absolute worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
