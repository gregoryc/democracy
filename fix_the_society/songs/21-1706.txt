Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't talk so they just succumb
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

Inert science they consecrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
You don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

CHORUS

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Change will come soon, it will come
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
There should be no division, no need to be separate

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
