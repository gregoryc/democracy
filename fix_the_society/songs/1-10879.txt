Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Away from the truth they hid
Acting worse than the most maldeveloped, stubborn kid

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

The state of science is, wholly inert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Same ideology to the grave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
The state of science is, wholly inert

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, got them acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They make broad statements while acting like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
