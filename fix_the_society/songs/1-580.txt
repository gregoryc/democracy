Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

The society itself, they completely neglect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect

They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave
Same ideology to the grave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to learn, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention

In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
They act like a retard

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
They can't alter anything, they are inert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
