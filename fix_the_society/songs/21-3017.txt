Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb
Change will come soon, it will come
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate

CHORUS

They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
Inert science they consecrate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
