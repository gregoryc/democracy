Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

This is wholesale, in every aspect
Animalism is something they want to resurrect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the disaffected they infect

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
Don't care about reason, they have no regard

Red flags are pulsating, everyone should be alert
Away from the truth, on the outskirt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This negligence is poison, the young they infect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

CHORUS

Preordained, they already know their fave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave

Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't want to observe, act just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid

VERSE

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Unmoving, unchanging, science is inert

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
