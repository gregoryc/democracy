Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They hate themselves, they do not respect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This needs to be called out, one should be direct

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
When things are wrong for decades, no one will be alert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to delve, act just like a kid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

Reason is what they want to discard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

Same ideology to the grave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
They enjoy suffering, they can only conceive of there being a slave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

CHORUS

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, got you behaving like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

VERSE

The society is the ones who hurt
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss

Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
