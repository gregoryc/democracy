Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not right
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't talk so they just succumb

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

VERSE

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Protesting your problems will make you best
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
