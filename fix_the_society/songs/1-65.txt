Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Away from the truth they hid

If you talk to them they miss the subject
Destruction and doom is what they architect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They act like a retard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

They don't want to understand, act like a kid
There's a giant price they pay, but there ain't no bid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert

We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
