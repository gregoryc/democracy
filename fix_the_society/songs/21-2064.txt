Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
Protesting your problems will make you best
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't put their ideas forth, if they did they'd circulate
A mine of ideas, we should detonate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
Inert science they consecrate
