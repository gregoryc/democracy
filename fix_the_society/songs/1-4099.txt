VERSE

They don't think properly, they cannot introspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Try to have a conversation with them one time and they only misdirect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
This is too insidious for many to detect
The results are horrible, just look at the effect
The society itself, you completely neglect

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite introverted, not an extrovert

Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
