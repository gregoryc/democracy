Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
You don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

CHORUS

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from

They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

VERSE

There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed

They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't talk to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
