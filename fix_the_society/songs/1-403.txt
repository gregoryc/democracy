VERSE

This is not right, this is completely incorrect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct

To human ideals, they don't want to connect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
The society is the ones who hurt

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Socially preordained, don't dare to question, act just like a kid

CHORUS

They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard

Away from the truth, on the outskirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Tunnel vision, got them behaving like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

VERSE

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
