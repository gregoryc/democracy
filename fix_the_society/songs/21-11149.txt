Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
Change will come soon, it will come

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

CHORUS

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Inert science they consecrate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate

We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed

If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight

VERSE

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight

Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
