VERSE

No one will be unhurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

The most base impulses is something they want to resurrect
I must speak here, I must interject
This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
The society itself, you completely neglect

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Climate catastrophes on the brink, they don't want to avert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
The society is the ones who hurt

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss

CHORUS

This has gone on too long, too long unchecked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
This is too insidious for many to detect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

VERSE

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
