Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Things are not good, they are not right

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome

The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed

VERSE

It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Things are not good, they are not alright

No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

Inert science they consecrate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate

We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate

They act like demons, ones who are possessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
