Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Not talking isn't going to divert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
Harsh punishment is what people endure, to that they are subject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
They act like a retard

They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert

CHORUS

Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Whining and complaining like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Preordained, they already know their fave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
