Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
The need to learn how to speak, they need to learn to articulate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest
They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

CHORUS

They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

There should be no division, no need to be separate
Inert science they consecrate
They don't want to protest anything, perhaps we should start to agitate
They just need to speak their mind, they don't even need to calculate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

The beat goes on and on, on the drum
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
It's important to communicate, with all your might

They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
