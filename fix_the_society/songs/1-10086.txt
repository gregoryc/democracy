Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Don't want to immerse, act just like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid
There's a giant price you pay, but there ain't no bid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
The society itself, they completely neglect

It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss

Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
This is not right, this is completely incorrect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

Try to talk about something true, they only redirect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
They don't speak the language of the people or their dialect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
They treat others as an "other", they treat others as a sect
