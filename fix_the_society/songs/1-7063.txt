Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this

The society itself, you completely neglect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

Same ideology to the grave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave

They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
You don't want to understand, act like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their sanity is backwards, they want to invert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard

They want you to witness the hell of the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

CHORUS

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Away from the truth they hid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

VERSE

They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

Their ideas are narrow, they always select
They disregard the mind, they don't care about the intellect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
