Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
It's important to talk, with all your might
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't talk so they just succumb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

It don't matter at all, about politics or income
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
Protesting your problems will make you best
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's time to put a little melody in the fight, when we hum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

There should be no division, no need to be separate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not alright
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
There should be no division, no need to be separate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
Don't need no bots, we won't accommodate
They don't protest anything, other ideas they needlessly denigrate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
