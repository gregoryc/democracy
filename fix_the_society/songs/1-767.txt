VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Their minds, they cannot exert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Mind's gone to oblivion, they ain't alert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert

They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Predetermined thought is that of a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
It is so rude, I just need to diss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
They regurgitate garbage, they only reassert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt

Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
They can't alter anything, they are inert
These guys are a bunch of bitches, perhaps one should buy them a miniskirt

CHORUS

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Too long has this gone on, it should have been checked
Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They hate themselves, they do not respect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
This is a giant mess, it is wrecked

With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
All with their clique, eating their dessert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
The society is the ones who hurt
No one will be unhurt
They already claim to "know", they just blurt

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
