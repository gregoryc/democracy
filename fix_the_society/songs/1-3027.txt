Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Away from the truth they hid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, got you acting like a kid
Stop this already, time to get rid

Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard

CHORUS

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
The truth is what they wish to disregard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

The society is the ones who hurt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Their minds, they cannot exert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
