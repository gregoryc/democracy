VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
Thinking differently shouldn't have to be hard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

CHORUS

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Playing only the worst card
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard

They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They deserve to be combated, with the truth we should bombard
Reason is what they want to discard

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

VERSE

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They failure is a sight to truly behold, I swear it's avant-garde

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They always evade, they always run

CHORUS

VERSE

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Asserting for the sake of asserting but acting just like a kid
Away from the truth they hid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't have to do with ego or id

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Stop this already, time to get rid
You make broad claims while looking like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Not obeying the hivemind doesn't have to do with the bid
