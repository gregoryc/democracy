Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Differing viewpoints they never forgave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Hiding away, just like in a cave

With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Away from the truth they hid
Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Not wanting to see any sides of anything, acting like the most juvenile kid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They want the status quo, it's all they crave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave

The world is the thing they cannot save
Preordained, they already know their fave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave

The state of science is, wholly inert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
An open conversation, they always divert
They do junk, they do dirt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

CHORUS

They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

They act like a retard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in a junkyard
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

They always evade, they always run
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
Their behavior makes them charred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
They act like a retard

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
