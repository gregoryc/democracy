Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

CHORUS

Away from the truth they hid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
They make broad claims while looking like a kid

Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
So zealously fixed they are, they act like a true diehard
They act like a retard

They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Their minds, they cannot exert
They do junk, they do dirt
Negligence is off the charts, no one's been alert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
The full picture is something they habitually disregard
They act like a retard

VERSE

Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
All with their clique, eating their dessert
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Any novel idea, they want to discard
They act like a retard
So angry they are at anything, they act like a true diehard
Their behavior makes them charred
Playing only the worst card

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention
