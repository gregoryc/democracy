Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ideology for the sake of ideology, just a kid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded

All with their clique, eating their dessert
You already claim to "know", they just blurt
With fixed ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Their non sense is in your face, it is very overt

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Away from the truth they hid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Whining and crying like a kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

VERSE

Stop this already, time to get rid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Whining and throwing a fit like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Absolute statements, but act like a kid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Having an open mind, should not be so hard

Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
Too bad, awful, acting just like a kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Don't have to do with ego or id
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

CHORUS

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Same ideology to the grave
Hiding away, just like in a cave
The world is the thing they cannot save

The society itself, they completely neglect
The lies are put forth, the lies they erect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select
