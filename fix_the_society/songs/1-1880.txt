Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Reason is what they want to discard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred
Don't care about anyone, you have no regard
They act like a retard

Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard

It's not a matter if something is “proper,” if it is correct
To human ideals, they don't want to connect
This is not politcal at all, it don't matter who you elect
The society itself, they completely neglect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

CHORUS

Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Don't want to go into, act just like a kid
Don't have to do with ego or id
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Their insularity is magnitudinous, disregarding it is hard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
We don't live in this alone, all of us intersect
Destruction and doom is what they architect

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

VERSE

This is not good at all, this is not fun
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt
An open conversation, they always divert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
