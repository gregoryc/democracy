Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Inert science they consecrate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

Things are not good, they are not alright
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Bring forth the flame, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed

It's time to rap and sing, it's time to hum
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

If you don't communicate to resolve your problems, what a mess you will become
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
The beat goes on and on, on the drum

They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate

Anyone who doesn't talk is certainly a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
The beat goes on and on, on the drum
They don't talk so they just succumb

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate
Their forefathers they just emulate, they just imitate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They act just like an animal, an animal we should domesticate

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk

VERSE

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk

They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
If you don't communicate to resolve your plight, what a mess you will become
Change will come soon, it will come
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
