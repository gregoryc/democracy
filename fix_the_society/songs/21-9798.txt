Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They act like demons, ones who are possessed

The truth, is something that has been for too long suppressed
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
We need to fight, in order to get rest

Change will come soon, it will come
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
It's time to put a little music in the fight, when we hum
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
Anyone who doesn't protest is definitely a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

Ho-ho-ho, hohum
They don't wanna talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb
Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
The beat goes on and on and on, on the drum

If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
It's important to talk, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not right

CHORUS

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Things are not good, they are not alright

Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't care about the proper state, all they do is discriminate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest

They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate

Science is inert, they don't care where we come from
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be depressed, music can make you be not glum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum

VERSE

Things are not good, they are not right
Things are not good, they are not alright
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not right
It's important to communicate, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
