Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't protest their problems, maybe they should retaliate
We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
Things are not good, they are not alright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
Whining and bickering with no communication, is what we should eliminate
They're afraid of even little things, you know they won't assassinate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate

They don't oppose this tragedy, they don't protest
We need to fight, in order to get rest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Think of all the good things if your thoughts are expressed

VERSE

Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
Protesting your problems will make you best
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed

They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
Anyone who doesn't talk is definitely a scum
They act like they're in the ghetto, from the slum
It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum

We need a unification of thoughts, we all need to desegregate
They don't even talk, all they do is forcefully dominate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

We need to fight, in order to get rest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
