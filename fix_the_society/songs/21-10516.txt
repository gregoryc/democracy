Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
Their destruction is imminent, themselves they want to annihilate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
If you don't talk to resolve your issues, what a mess you will become
They don't want to talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't want to converse, fee-fi-foe-fum, hohum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

They don't want to protest anything, maybe we should start to agitate
They do not talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Their minds will worsen, they will deteriorate
The culture must be altered, the thing we should all elevate
They should share their ideas, they should not hide them and segregate

We need full conversations, not just smalltalk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk
They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum
We need a little music and conversation, it's time to get some
They don't talk so they just succumb
We shall prevail, we shall overcome
They don't want to talk to resolve their problems, they just wanna act dumb

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

VERSE

People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum
Ho-ho-ho, hohum
It don't matter at all, about politics or income
Anyone who doesn't protest is certainly a scum
They don't care about people's pain, they act numb
They don't wanna talk to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb

It's not about the money, it ain't about the sum
They don't want to communicate to resolve their issues, they just wanna act dumb
No need to be sad, music can make you be not glum
If you communicate, there's a guaranteed good outcome
People need to communicate to solve their problems, it's no time to be mum

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

There should be no division, no need to be separate
They don't think freely, they don't even contemplate
We can make change, these rhymes will accelerate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate

They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed
We need to do this now, we are hardpressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

CHORUS

We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
You're unstoppable, won't be no arrest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest

Anyone who doesn't communicate is certainly a scum

It's important to talk, with all your might
Don't need no malice, don't need no spite
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

Things are not good, they are not alright

Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They don't want to talk, lost in the abyss of the night
Bring forth the energy, make the night alight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
