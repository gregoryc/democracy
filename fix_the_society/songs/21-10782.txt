Subject matter | Category 21 -- Not resorting to communication or protest to resolve these.

VERSE

They don't oppose this hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Call me unhappy, call me unimpressed
Sometimes it's right to have a reasonable amount of unrest

They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
We should talk about all the lies, and fight for the oppressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest
They don't oppose this nightmare, they don't protest
We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest

Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

No discussion present, their forefathers they just emulate
They waste their time with garbage, their problems won't abate
They don't talk to resolve their issues, they don't communicate
Among their insular cliques they congregate

As N.W.A says, your thoughts are best expressed
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
Bring forth that vigor, bring forth that zest

They do not talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
They just want to be insular, amongst themselves they commiserate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate
They don't protest their problems, perhaps they should retaliate
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate

If they would have some conversations, that would be utterly great
They must share their ideas, their communications they must disseminate
Among their insular cliques they congregate
No communication whatsoever, no talk and no debate
They don't talk to resolve their problems, they don't communicate
Their minds are coming apart, I swear they will disintegrate

CHORUS

They don't want to communicate, they don't want to talk
When the thought of resolving a confusion comes in their mind, they just balk
They act just like depressed kids, sitting on the sidewalk
It's a sad picture, with a sad walk

Things are not good, they are not alright
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight
It's important to communicate, with all your might
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
If you start to communicate, your words will become great dynamite

Things are not good, they are not right
If you communicate, the future will look rather bright
They're stagnant and complacent, they don't want to fight
Bring forth the vigor, make the night alight
Communication is the proper, way of resolving ones plight

VERSE

We'll fight, all the ways these creeps have transgressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed

Stagnation and lies are all I detest
I'm too overwhelmed, I'm too stressed
They don't oppose this abyss, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Doesn't matter what these douchebags have already assessed

They don't oppose this fucking hell, they don't protest
When you protest your problems, you won't be depressed
Stagnation and lies are all I detest
They need to communicate their mind, say everything that has been repressed
There are far, far too many things, left unaddressed
