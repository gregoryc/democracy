Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
Avoiding the truth, away they skirt
Everything is wrong, but no one to alert
Their minds, they cannot exert
They already claim to "know", they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard

Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They're messed up as all hell, their character is deprave

They don't think about things, it doesn't matter if they reflect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This negligence is poison, the young they infect
They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
They don't think properly, they cannot introspect

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

This is too unreasonable, what could one expect
One should bring about change, one can see the effect
This is plain, anyone can detect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect

So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
They can't tolerate novelty, they won't insert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
All with their clique, eating their dessert

They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
This is not good at all, this is not fun

No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
The society is the ones who hurt
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert

CHORUS

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Maybe they only care about money, what was the bid
Away from the truth they hid
You don't think, they act like a kid
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid

Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

Reason itself resides in their place of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

VERSE

Lack of thought makes an grown-up the absolute worst kid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid
Maybe the rebels and true communicators are off the grid

Any novelty, they have disregarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
