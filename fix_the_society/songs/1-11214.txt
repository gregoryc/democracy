Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
They aren't empirical, they do not inspect
Get rid of negligence, take it and eject
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention
We need change, we need intervention
Reason itself resides in their territory of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention
They have no genuine intention

Telling them the truth sometime, might set them off guard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in a junkyard
They act like a retard

CHORUS

Into the void they plunge everyone, into the abyss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
It is so rude, I just need to diss

Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded

The speeches of the past, they only wish to engrave
Fascism and authoritarianism permeates the airwave
The world is the thing they cannot save
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave

Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Don't care about reason, they have no regard
Reason is what they want to discard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

They are failures, down at the boulevard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard

VERSE

Their behavior is garbage, it should be thrown in the junkyard
They act like a retard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Dealing with nonexistent scientists is hard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

It is so rude, I just need to diss
This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
Without conversation, we're all headed to the abyss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
