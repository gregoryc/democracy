Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Their remissness is spectacular, the world they've bombarded

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Complete neglect, complete inattention
We need change, we need intervention
They have no genuine intention
Thinking itself resides in their territory of circumvention

This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect
The society itself, they completely neglect
Need to clean up everything, not merely disinfect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
Their insularity is flat-out wrong, more than just suspect
Their ideas are narrow, they always select

They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect
They don't care about pain or the past, they don't want to recollect
This has gone on too long, too long unchecked

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Their behavior makes them charred
Their behavior is garbage, it should be dumped in the junkyard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
They act like a retard

Any novel idea, they want to discard
No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
They walk down the Loser boulevard
They're prone to true violence, they want to use weapons to bombard

Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
They are failures, down at the boulevard
They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Having a little curiousity, cannot be hard

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave

VERSE

Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Stuck in slavery, in the shipyard
In their ivory tower, with the castle and guard
Enlightment values is not something they safeguard
They act like a retard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
Through their neglegence, everyone they affect
This is in an insult to everyone, not just disrespect

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
Their minds, they cannot exert
Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
No one will be unhurt

CHORUS

They are thugs and creeps, don't want no bodyguard
Juvenile as can be, stuck in the yard
They act like a retard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

Any novelty, they have disregarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done

With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
No one will be unhurt
So enamored by their own non sense, to themselves they flirt
Quite introverted, not an extrovert
Their acceptance of conversation, is down in the dirt

Differing viewpoints they never forgave
They can't do anything right, they only misbehave
Their mind is an oven, just like a microwave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
Humanity in itself, they want to enslave
