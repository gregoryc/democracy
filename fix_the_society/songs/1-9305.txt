Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Their sucked in their circle, they never wave
Preordained, they already know their fave
Modesty and humility, they never gave
They act as bad as possible, they don't know how to behave
The world is the thing they cannot save
Cowardice abounds with them, they arent brave

Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone
They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

Don't have to do with ego or id
Tunnel vision, everyone and everything they forbid
Childish tunnel vision, acting just like a kid
What horrendous non sense these creeps did
Cutting out the conversation, putting on the lid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid

The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded

CHORUS

It is so rude, I just need to diss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss

They don't have decency, they automatically disregard
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
Overcoming true inertia, unmovingness is hard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde

Quite fixed in their thinking, they all introvert
They do junk, they do dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
The society is the ones who hurt
Away from the truth, on the outskirt

Their open mindedness, that's down in the dirt
With pre-thought of ideas, they automatically assert
No one will be unhurt
Completely ineffective as they put on their shirt
Science is in truth fundamentally inert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded

VERSE

They have no genuine intention
We need change, we need intervention
Thinking itself resides in their place of circumvention
Complete neglect, complete inattention

All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
There are too many good ideas that one should not dismiss

They don't want conversation, when you tell them truth they don't even reject
This is wholesale, in every aspect
They want man lower, lower just as if an insect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
To human ideals, you don't want to connect

Their own principles are something they do not respect
This negligence is poison, the vulnerable they infect
They're a complete failure, they only neglect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
This is wholesale, in every aspect
