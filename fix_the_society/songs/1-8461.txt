Subject matter | Category 1 -- Abuse of philosophical universalism (making broad claims while intentionally not trying to understand things or see any sides of anything whatsoever, childish behavior worse than a 3 year old, acting retarded)

VERSE

Away from the truth they hid
They're such failures, themselves they outdid
Can we stop this, their non sense they overdid
Stop this already, time to get rid
Reactive maldeveloped sounds because they don't like science, acting like the worst kid
Towards the realm of insanity they already slid

This is something you can't comprehend, we can't comprehend this
Ignorance is not happiness, negligence is not bliss
They are completely negligent, they are utterly remiss
All of this rudeness is something you would not miss
They want you to witness the hell of the abyss

CHORUS

Their mind is made up, they just blurt
With automatic ideas, they automatically assert
Disingenuous to the extreme, the society they subvert
Any progress is fleeting with them, they revert

Any novel ideas, they automatically have discarded
The clique is so insular, I swear they're retarded
Any novelty, they have disregarded
Violence is second nature to them, their friends they've bombarded
Enlightenment values, they have not safeguarded
Brittle as possible, they are truly unguarded

No novel thinking, not in their backyard
They act like a retard
Behaving just like in the schoolyard
Tunnel vision, true empiricism is barred

They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
Data and observation, they don't dare to collect
The only focus on "responses", they just want to deflect
This is too big for most, too hard to dissect
Politicians don't matter, don't matter who you reelect

VERSE

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
They always evade, they always run
Soon their tyranny will be over, over and done
This should be opposed by brave individuals, a special someone

They don't care about anyone, don't need no bodyguard
Working don't matter for this, whether day or graveyard
Their neglect is out of this world, I swear it's avant-garde
They don't care about your feelings, they don't regard
They are failures, down at the boulevard

Communication is the solution, people must interconnect
They don't want to discuss, they don't want to reinspect
They don't speak for people's best interests, they only neglect
This is completely wrong, it is not correct
This leads to great ruin, this is the disconnect
They won't think back, they won't think in retrospect

They don't care about you, they don't care about everyone
They always evade, they always run
They don't care about people at all, they don't care about anyone
This is not good at all, this is not fun
